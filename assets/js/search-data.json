TOC {:toc} --- ## Abstract {#S:0.1} For years, RNAs were thought to have only two broad functions in cells, transmitting information between DNA and protein as messenger RNA (mRNA), and playing structural, catalytic, information decoding roles in protein synthesis as ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA). However, the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) changed this picture. RNAi is a regulatory process that uses small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) to suppress gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. This discovery led to identification of many classes of functional ncRNAs. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a class of such ncRNAs with ∼22 nucleotides that are abundant and found in most eukaryotic cells. This thesis focuses on revealing regulatory roles and characteristics of miRNAs through bioinformatics approaches by addressing three research questions. The first research question is whether we can enhance miRNAs target prediction in animals by considering multiple target sites. Many algorithms exist for miRNA target predictions, but most algorithms do not consider multiple target sites. Predicting accurate miRNA target genes is important to infer miRNA regulatory roles since annotations of miRNA regulations are still poor. To solve this possible fault, we developed a two step support vector machine (SVM) model. Benchmark tests showed that our two step model outperformed other existing miRNA target prediction algorithms. The second research question is whether there are factors to explain differences between different miRNA high-throughput experiments. There are several high-throughput technologies widely used for miRNA experiments, such as microarray and quantitative proteomics, but the results from these technologies are often inconsistent. By statistically analyzing several such high-throughput miRNA experiments, we revealed the characteristic of different technologies and also identified several factors that cause the differences. The third research question is whether miRNAs interact with other classes of ncRNAs. There are strong evidences that some miRNAs are involved in transcription by interacting with other ncRNAs. We investigated ncRNAs in complex loci to find potential miRNA:ncRNA interactions. A complex locus is a locus that contains multiple genes that interact between themselves. We found evidence that some miRNAs are involved in transcriptional regulation with ncRNAs in complex loci. In summary, this thesis provides solutions for these research questions, and it contributes to a better understanding of several important aspects of miRNA characteristics and regulations. It also shows effective bioinformatics approaches to develop a robust machine learning model and analyze different miRNA high-throughput experiments. ## Acknowledgements {#S:0.2} This thesis is based on four years of research funded by the Functional Genomics Program of the Norwegian Research Council.

TOC {:toc} --- ## 1.1 Challenges {#S:1.1} In the 1980s, most non-protein-coding regions in the genome were thought to be 'junk' DNA with no functional purpose {% cite Orgel1980 -f {{ bib }} %}. Nonetheless, during the last two decades, new classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that have gene regulatory roles have been discovered within these 'junk' regions {% cite Wright2011 -f {{ bib }} %}. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one such new class of ncRNAs that have many important regulatory roles on a genome-wide scale {% cite Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. Because of their importance, research on miRNAs has gained popularity in recent years (Fig. [1.1](#F:1.1)). Although many research efforts have revealed basic miRNA characteristic and regulation {% cite Bartel2004 Bartel2009 -f {{ bib }} %}, there are still many challenges to identify the comprehensive characteristics and precise regulatory mechanism of miRNAs. This thesis covers three such challenges related to miRNA studies. ### &nbsp; {#F:1.1} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 1.1]({{ fig1_1 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig1_1[1] }}\"} #### **Figure 1.1**. PubMed query. {: .no_toc .text-caption } Two figures show the trend of miRNA related papers as **(A)** the number of papers, and **(B)** the ratio to all papers in PubMed. {: .fs-2 } --- The first challenge is to identify accurate miRNA targets in animals. It is important to understand miRNA contributions to the genome-wide gene regulation, but there are several known obstacles related to indentifying miRNA targeRts in animals. Firstly, miRNAs are quite abundant {% cite Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}, and one miRNA can potentially regulate many protein-coding genes {% cite Friedman2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. In some cases, miRNAs bind their target mRNAs by base-pairing with only six nucleotides {% cite Friedman2009 -f {{ bib }} %}, which results in thousands of potential candidate genes influenced by one miRNA at a genome-wide level. Secondly, since miRNAs are expressed in a cell- or tissue-specific manner {% cite Wang2009b -f {{ bib }} %}, one true positive miRNA target can be a false positive in a different cell or tissue type. Thirdly, the precise mechanism of miRNA binding process on its target mRNA is unknown {% cite Bartel2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Therefore, combinations of miRNA features are usually used to predict miRNA targets, but the combined effects of these features on miRNA targeting are unclear. The second challenge is to interpret miRNA high-throughput data appropriately with high accuracy. Microarray, next generation sequencing, and quantitative proteomics are three major high-throughput technologies widely used for miRNA studies. Nonetheless, analyses of the data from these high-throughput technologies often give different interpretations regarding miRNA characteristics and regulation {% cite Baek2008 Selbach2008 Wen2011 -f {{ bib }} %}. A major obstacle is that there are many factors involved in these analyses, but the main factors that cause these differences are unknown. The third challenge is to indentify potential miRNA interactions with other ncRNAs. Although most miRNAs regulate genes at the post-transcriptional level, some miRNAs can also regulate transcription itself {% cite Place2008 Kim2008 Younger2011 -f {{ bib }} %}. This transcriptional regulation seems to involve ncRNAs overlapping or interacting with the target gene promoters {% cite Han2007 Morris2011 Morris2008 Schwartz2008 Yue2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. Many aspects of this miRNA regulation at the transcription level are poorly understood. Moreover, few experimental data are available for this miRNA regulation at the transcription level. ## 1.2 Goals {#S:1.2} The main goal of this thesis is to reveal the characteristics and regulations of miRNAs by analyzing several different types of high-throughput data through bioinformatics approaches. To achieve this goal, I defined three sub-goals to solve the three challenges of miRNA studies described in the previous section. The first sub-goal is to develop a miRNA target prediction algorithm with high accuracy. Most existing prediction algorithms focus on identifying individual target sites without considering multiple target sites. They do not include multiple target sites that possibly contribute to miRNA regulation. Moreover, most algorithms use strict filtering, such as filtering with evolutional conservation. Filtering can reduce false positive miRNA targets, but it potentially removes many true positive targets at the same time. Therefore, the aim of this sub-goal is to develop a model that can predict unbiased miRNA targets by considering multiple targets without filtering. The second sub-goal is to analyze several different types of miRNA high-throughput technologies. The aim of this sub-goal is to reveal the characteristics of each technology and identify strong factors that cause inconsistent results between different types of experiments by statistical approaches. The third sub-goal is to infer potential miRNA regulations outside of 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) in general and interactions between miRNAs and ncRNAs in complex loci in particular. A complex locus is a region of DNA that contains multiple genes that have interactions between them or share common regulatory mechanisms {% cite Engstrom2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. Our hypothesis is that some miRNAs interact with ncRNA:mRNA pairs in complex loci. The aim of this sub-goal is to investigate this hypothesis of miRNA involvement in complex loci together with miRNA regulations outside of 3' UTRs by computationally analyzing the data from high-throughput experiments. In this thesis, these sub-goals are referred to in italic to clarify the relationship between parts of the text and their corresponding sub-goals if necessary. - First sub-goal: *[miRNA target prediction]({{ path_prediction }}/)* - Second sub-goal: *[miRNA high-throughput experiments]({{ path_experiment }}/)* - Third sub-goal: *[miRNA and other ncRNAs]({{ path_ncrna }}/)* ## 1.3 Thesis structure {#S:1.3} This thesis consists of eight chapters followed by five papers. [Chapter Two: Papers and their corresponding sub-goals.]({{ path_thesis }}/2-papers-and-their-corresponding-sub-goals/) This chapter summarizes the five papers included in this thesis. It also relates them to each sub-goal. [Chapter Three: MicroRNAs and other non-coding RNAs.]({{ path_thesis }}/3-micrornas-and-other-non-coding-rnas/) This chapter introduces the history, characteristics, and biological functions of miRNAs as well as some additional information about other ncRNAs. [Chapter Four: High-throughput biological experiments.]({{ path_thesis }}/4-high-throughput-biological-experiments/) This chapter focuses on three high-throughput technologies used in our research: microarray, next generation sequencing, and quantitative proteomics.

TOC {:toc} --- This thesis includes five papers, and each paper has a corresponding sub-goal (Table [2.1](#T:2.1)). This chapter gives a brief description of paper in context of each sub-goal. ### **Table 2.1**. Papers and corresponding sub-goals of our research. {#T:2.1} {: .no_toc .text-caption } | **Sub-goal** | **Paper No.** | **Title** |--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------| [miRNA target prediction]({{ path_prediction }}/) | [Paper 1]({{ path_prediction }}/{{ page.pages.review }}/) | MicroRNAs - targeting and target prediction | | [Paper 2]({{ path_prediction }}/{{ page.pages.two_step_svm }}/) | A two step site and mRNA-level model for predicting microRNA targets | | Paper 5 | Inferring causative variants in microRNA target sites | [miRNA high-throughput experiments]({{ path_experiment }}/) | [Paper 3]({{ path_experiment }}/{{ page.pages.confounding }}) | Target gene expression levels and competition between transfected and endogenous microRNAs are strong factors in high-throughput experiments | [miRNA and other ncRNAs]({{ path_ncrna }}/) | Paper 4 |MicroRNAs affect gene expression by targeting cis-transcribed non-coding RNAs | --- ## 2.1 Three papers for the first sub-goal: *miRNA target prediction* {#S:2.1} **[Paper 1]({{ path_prediction }}/{{ page.pages.review }}/): MicroRNAs - targeting and target prediction**. This review paper outlines the features associated with animal miRNA targeting. It summarizes the characteristics of the features in six different categories: miRNA:mRNA paring, Site location, Conservation, Site accessibility, Multiple sites, and Expression profiles. It also contains a list of 30 different miRNA target prediction tools with information of feature coverage in context of the six categories. **[Paper 2]({{ path_prediction }}/{{ page.pages.two_step_svm }}/): A two step site and mRNA-level model for predicting microRNA targets**. This paper presents a miRNA target prediction model that recognizes both the individual characteristics of functional binding sites and the global characteristics of miRNA-targeted mRNAs. Our novel two-step SVM model trains site level features at the first step, and, subsequently, it trains mRNA level features at the second step. Benchmark experiments showed that our two-step SVM model had a higher overall performance than other established miRNA target prediction tools. **Paper 5: Inferring causative variants in microRNA target sites**. This paper shows an example that miRNA predictions from our two-step SVM model performs better than the other prediction algorithms when the predictions are used by other tools. Laurent F. Thomas was the main contributor to this study, and he developed a tool that can help identifying Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with diseases by focusing on SNPs affecting miRNA regulation. The tool uses miRNA target predictions to check the influence of SNPs that affect miRNA targeting. It can use any miRNA prediction tools that generate scores of miRNA target predictions. The paper showed that the tool had the best performance when our two-step SVM model was used. ## 2.2 One paper for the second sub-goal: *miRNA high-throughput experiments* {#S:2.2} **[Paper 3]({{ path_experiment }}/{{ page.pages.confounding }}/): Target gene expression levels and competition between transfected and endogenous microRNAs are strong confounding factors in microRNA high-throughput experiments**. This paper shows characteristics of different miRNA high-throughput experiments. Analysis on these high-throughput experiment data sometimes show inconsistent miRNA regulation factors, for example, one experiment shows 3' UTR length is one of the most important factors, whereas other experiment shows it is least important. We investigated several factors that might affect this inconsistence, and we revealed that competition between endogenous miRNAs and the ectopically expressed miRNAs significantly contributed to the differences among different miRNA high-throughput experiments. We also found that this competition effect affected other factors, such as mRNA expression level and 3' UTR length, in terms of miRNA targeting. ## 2.3 One paper for the third sub-goal: *miRNA and other ncRNAs* {#S:2.3} **Paper 4: MicroRNAs affect gene expression by targeting cis-transcribed non-coding RNAs**. This paper shows potential miRNA regulation on two types of complex loci: cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs) and chromatin associated RNAs (CARs). We used several different types of data from high-throughput miRNA experiments to infer potential miRNA regulation on such loci. Our statistical analyses revealed that complex loci containing non-coding cis-NATs or CARs appeared to be under strong regulation, although this type of miRNA targeting is less prevalent than miRNA targeting of 3' UTRs.

TOC {:toc} --- Since our main goal is to reveal the miRNA regulation and characteristics, this chapter introduces several different aspects of miRNAs, such as the history of miRNA discovery, miRNA biogenesis, and mechanism of miRNA regulation. In addition to miRNAs, it also describes several other classes of ncRNAs and their potential interactions with miRNAs. Specifically, analysis on such ncRNAs is the main objective of the third sub-goal: *[miRNA and other ncRNAs]({{ path_ncrna }}/)*. ## 3.1 Thousands of miRNAs have been identified since the first miRNA discovery of *lin-4* in 1993 {#T:3.1} In 1993, Lee et al. found that *lin-4*, a gene involved in development timing in *C. elegans*, produces a small ncRNA instead of a messenger RNA (mRNA) {% cite Lee1993 -f {{ bib }} %}. *lin-4* was known to regulate *lin-14*, but the protein product of *lin-4* had been undetected. The result of an alignment analysis indicated that *lin-4* has multiple complementary sites on the 3' UTR of *lin-14* {% cite Lee1993 -f {{ bib }} %}. Further experiment revealed that this small ncRNA produced by *lin-4* can directly suppress the expression of *lin-14* by base-paring on the 3' UTR. This was the first discovery of this functional ncRNA with about 22 nucleotides that regulates specific protein expression by base-paring on the 3' UTR of its target mRNA {% cite Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. However, there were no other *lin-4*-like small ncRNAs identified, and this peculiar regulation of *lin-4* was recognized as a rare case {% cite Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. Meanwhile, Fire et al. reported that they observed a gene silencing effect after injecting double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) into *C. elegans* {% cite Fire1998 -f {{ bib }} %} in 1998. They coined the term, RNA interference (RNAi), to describe this gene-silencing mechanism. Soon thereafter, RNAi was found to silence genes at the post-transcriptional level with small RNA molecules with 20-25 nucleotides, called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) {% cite Hamilton1999 Elbashir2001 Mello2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. Then, nearly seven years after the discovery of *lin-4*, Reinhart et al. identified a *lin-4*-like small ncRNA, *let-7*, in *C. elegans* in 2000 {% cite Reinhart2000 -f {{ bib }} %}. They revealed that *let-7* is also an ncRNA with about 22 nucleotides that regulates specific protein expression by base-paring on the 3' UTR. Since *let-7* has homologs in various species, this discovery led to identification of many other *let-7*- and *lin-4*-like small ncRNAs in other animals, including human and *Drosophila* {% cite Pasquinelli2000 -f {{ bib }} %}. The term microRNA (miRNA) was coined to refer to these small ncRNAs of about 22 nucleotide length {% cite Lagos-Quintana2001 Lau2001 Lee2001 -f {{ bib }} %}. Moreover, like siRNAs, miRNAs appeared to use the RNAi pathway to regulated genes at the post-transcriptional level {% cite Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. Today, miRNAs are recognized as a very common class of ncRNAs that can regulate protein expression {% cite Lagos-Quintana2001 Lau2001 Lee2001 Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. For instance, miRBase {% cite Griffiths-Jones2004 Griffiths-Jones2006 Griffiths-Jones2008 Kozomara2011 -f {{ bib }} %}, which is the main database for miRNA annotations, contains 15172 entries in 142 species as of release 16, 2010. They are abundant and found mostly in eukaryotes as well as in some viruses. MicroRNAs are known to play many important regulatory roles in eukaryotes {% cite Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}, whereas some viruses encode viral miRNA genes that potentially regulate fundamental cellular processes both in the viruses and in their host cells {% cite Nair2006 Boss2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. ## 3.2 MicroRNA biogenesis involves multiple steps {#T:3.2} Although the precise mechanism of miRNA biogenesis is unknown, Figure [3.1](#F:3.1) shows the most widely accepted view of the miRNA biogenesis to date. The biogenesis involves multiple processes both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. ### &nbsp; {#F:3.1} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 3.1]({{ fig3_1 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig3_1[1] }}\"} #### **Figure 3.1**. MicroRNA biogenesis. {: .no_toc .text-caption } The figure shows the overview of miRNA biogenesis. Pol II transcribes ssRNA from DNA. The ssRNA forms pri-miRNA, that is further processed to a hairpin loop structure called pre-miRNA by DGCR8 and Drosha. Exportin 5 together with Ran-GTP exports pre-miRNA into the cytoplasm. Dicer cleaves pre-miRNA to form miRNA duplex. Only one strand of the miRNA duplex is usually bound to the Argonaute protein and loaded into the RISC complex. {: .fs-2 } --- First, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes a miRNA gene on the chromosome from DNA to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) with 5' cap and poly-A tail {% cite Lee2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. This ssRNA called primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) can be several hundreds or thousands nucleotides long, and it may contain one or more hairpin loops {% cite Lee2002 -f {{ bib }} %}. An enzyme called DiGeorge Syndrome Critical Region 8 (DGCR8) recognizes the hairpin loop in pri-miRNA, and a DGCR8 associated enzyme, called Drosha, cleaves the hairpin from the pri-miRNA {% cite Lee2003 Denli2004 Gregory2004 Han2004 Landthaler2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. This cleavage results in a hairpin structure with approximately 60 nucleotides called precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) {% cite Saetrom2006 Lee2003 Zeng2003 Batuwita2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Exportin 5 together with Ran-GTP exports pre-miRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm {% cite Lund2004 Yi2003 -f {{ bib }} %}. In the cytoplasm, a Ribonuclease (RNase) III enzyme, called Dicer, cleaves the loop of pre-miRNA and produces a miRNA:miRNA\\* duplex with approximately 22 nucleotides {% cite Lee2003 -f {{ bib }} %}. Only one strand of this duplex usually becomes a mature miRNA as a guide to the target mRNA, and the other strand, defined as miRNA star-strand or miRNA\\* {% cite Lau2001 -f {{ bib }} %}, is eventually degraded {% cite Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. The mechanism of the strand selection is unclear, but a strand that is less thermodynamically stable at its 5' end appears to be favored in some cases {% cite Tomari2005 Kim2005 -f {{ bib }} %}. Argonaute (Ago) proteins are key proteins for miRNA targeting {% cite Fagard2000b -f {{ bib }} %}. Ago2, which is one of the Ago clade proteins, is mainly associated with mature miRNAs in mammals {% cite Carthew2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. A protein complex called RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) {% cite Hammond2000 -f {{ bib }} %} that incorporates Ago2, uses the mature miRNA as a guide to bind and then catalyze specific target mRNAs {% cite Carthew2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Moreover, there are several known alternative pathways for miRNA biogenesis. For instance, some intronic miRNAs bypass Drosha processing by directly forming a pre-miRNA-like hairpin structure. These intronic miRNAs are defined as mitrons {% cite Okamura2007 Ruby2007 -f {{ bib }} %} first identified in *Drosophila* and *C. elegans* {% cite Ruby2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, and also found in mammals {% cite Berezikov2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. Another example of alternative miRNA pathways is that RNA polymerase III (Pol III) instead of Pol II transcribes some miRNAs {% cite Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}, especially those residing upstream of Alu sequences {% cite Borchert2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. Alu sequences or Alu elements are abundant mobile elements especially found in the primate genomes {% cite Batzer2002 -f {{ bib }} %}. ## 3.3 RNA interference is the central mechanism for gene regulation by miRNAs and small interfering RNA {#T:3.3} MicroRNAs and siRNA regulate and control gene expression through RNAi {% cite Mello2004 Carthew2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Although siRNAs have biochemically indistinguishable mature forms of ssRNAs from those of miRNAs, the siRNA biogenesis pathway to its mature form is different from that of miRNA {% cite Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. Dicer processes siRNA precursors, such as long dsRNAs or small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), and cleaves them into a ~22 nt dsRNA with 2-nt 3' overhangs {% cite Bartel2004 Paddison2002 Carthew2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. This dsRNA form of siRNA is essentially equivalent with the miRNA:miRNA\\* duplex. Major functionalities of siRNAs and miRNAs are that siRNAs are defenders against foreign or invasive nucleic acid molecules such as viruses, transposons, and transgenes {% cite Mello2004 -f {{ bib }} %}, whereas miRNAs are regulators of endogenous protein-coding genes {% cite Carthew2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Moreover, exogenous siRNAs are widely used in gene knockdown experiments, and they are potentially useful for gene therapy. Exogenous siRNAs are directly introduced into the cytoplasm or taken up from the environment {% cite Mello2004 Carthew2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. The central mechanism of RNAi is that si/miRNAs loaded in RISC act like guides to bind the sites of their target mRNAs. The RISCs loaded with miRNAs are called miRISCs, whereas the RISCs with siRNAs are called siRISCs {% cite Carthew2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. RNAi has several different gene silencing modes (Fig. [3.2](#F:3.2)). The common gene silencing mode for siRNAs and plant miRNAs is cleaving mRNAs that have near-perfect complementary sites with the si/miRNAs (Fig. [3.2](#F:3.2)){% cite Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. Two known gene silencing modes for animal miRNAs are transcriptional repression and mRNA degradation (Fig. [3.2](#F:3.2)). In either mode, miRNAs mainly target mRNAs that have partial complementary sites on their 3' UTRs {% cite Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. Although translational repression was initially thought as the major regulatory model of animal miRNAs, a recent study used ribosome profiling assay and reported that most target genes of animal miRNAs were actually degraded {% cite Guo2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. The precise mechanism of this degradation is still unclear, but it is possibly associated with deadenylation, decapping, and exonucleolytic digestion of the mRNA {% cite Behm-Ansmant2006a Giraldez2006 Wu2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. ### &nbsp; {#F:3.2} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 3.2]({{ fig3_2 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig3_2[1] }}\"} #### **Figure 3.2**. miRNA target. {: .no_toc .text-caption } The figure shows three examples of RNAi regulation by miRISC and siRISC. The long curved line represents mRNA that is separated into three regions, 5' UTR, CDS, and 3' UTR. Ribosomes synthesize peptides while moving through the mRNA from 5' to 3' direction. One siRISC binds on the CDS and two miRISCs bind on the 3' UTR of mRNA, in this example. Plant miRNA and siRNA have nearly perfect complementary which results in mRNA cleavage. Animal miRNAs require only partial complementary, and they either repress translation or contribute to mRNA degradation. {: .fs-2 } --- Moreover, exogenous siRNAs are known to act like miRNAs and down-regulate numerous unintended mRNAs in the same way as miRNA gene silencing. This unintended effect is called siRNA off-targeting {% cite Jackson2003 -f {{ bib }} %}. Considering this siRNA off-targeting is very important to design effective exogenous siRNAs. ## 3.4 MicroRNAs have various regulatory roles that are associated with important physiological and pathological processes {#T:3.4} Many miRNAs play important regulatory roles by negatively controlling the expression level of mRNAs {% cite Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}, and current estimates indicate that at least 60% of human protein-coding genes are under some influence of miRNAs {% cite Friedman2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Many miRNAs, like *lin-4* and *let-7*, are involved in cell development processes {% cite Stefani2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Other experimentally validated miRNA regulatory roles can be found in many cellular processes, such as growth control, differentiation, stem cell and germline proliferation, and apoptosis {% cite Alvarez-Garcia2005 -f {{ bib }} %}. However, annotations of many miRNA regulations are still poor, therefore, predicting accurate miRNA target genes is important to infer miRNA regulatory roles. MicroRNAs are also associated with human diseases because of their wide range of gene regulatory roles {% cite Alvarez-Garcia2005 -f {{ bib }} %}. Several studies revealed miRNA involved diseases, such as cancer {% cite He2005 Lu2005 -f {{ bib }} %}, heart disease {% cite Chen2008 Zhao2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, DiGeorge syndrome {% cite Alvarez-Garcia2005 -f {{ bib }} %}, Alzheimer's disease, and central nerve system (CNS) disorders {% cite Maes2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Moreover, some viruses encode viral miRNA genes {% cite Nair2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. These viral miRNAs potentially regulate fundamental cellular processes both in the viruses and in their host cells {% cite Boss2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. ## 3.5 Multiple properties of miRNA target recognition may enhance target efficacy in animal {#T:3.5} Since most animal miRNAs have only partial complementary to their target mRNAs {% cite Bartel2009 -f {{ bib }} %}, miRNA targeting usually requires additional features for better target recognition. The most important feature is the seed type, which is the region for the partial complementary. The seed site contains six nucleotides from position 2 to 7 of the miRNA {% cite Lewis2003 Brennecke2005 Bartel2009 -f {{ bib }} %}, as the position begins with 1 at the 5' end of the miRNA. Even though the definition of the seed site is ubiquitous, the definition of the seed types is different among different studies. Figure [3.3](#F:3.3) shows nine common seed types that are widely accepted in many studies. Seed types consist of stringent and non-stringent groups. Three seed types, 7mer-A1, 7mer-m8, and 8mer, belong to the stringent group (Fig. [3.3](#F:3.3)). These seed types have perfect Watson-Crick paring in their seed sites, and they are usually stronger than those in the non-stringent groups in terms of miRNA target recognition {% cite Bartel2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. 7mer-A1 has an adenine (A) at position 1 of the target mRNA. An adenine at position 1 of the mRNA is known to enhance miRNA target recognition {% cite Lewis2005 -f {{ bib }} %}. 7mer-m8 has paring at position 8. 8mer has an adenine at position 1 and paring at position 8. The non-stringent group consists of 6mer, two G:U wobble, one loop, and two bulge types (Fig. [3.3](#F:3.3)) {% cite Gaidatzis2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. They are less effective than the stringent group, but they are still functional since miRISC can tolerate some mismatches {% cite Ellwanger2011 -f {{ bib }} %}. 6mer has perfect seed paring, whereas the other types are equivalent to 8mers except one mismatch or wobble paring. LP has a loop in the seed site. GUM has a G:U wobble site on the miRNA whereas GUT has a wobble site on the target mRNA. Similarly, BM has a bulge on the miRNA whereas BT has a bulge on the target mRNA. ### &nbsp; {#F:3.3} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 3.3]({{ fig3_3 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig3_3[1] }}\"} #### **Figure 3.3**. miRNA seed types. {: .no_toc .text-caption } Examples of three stringent seed types (8mer, 7mer-A1, and 7mer-m8), and six non-stringent seed types (6mer, GUM, GUT, LP, BM, and MT). The strand on the top of each seed type represents position 1-8/9 of miRNA, and the bottom strand represents target mRNAs. {: .fs-2 } --- Additional paring at the 3' part of miRNAs can increase the efficacy of miRNA repression, and it can also compensate for a seed mismatch to create a functional site {% cite Bartel2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Three to four matches at position 13-16 for stringent seeds, and four to five matches at position 13-19 for non-stringent seeds are known as 3' supplementary and 3' compensatory paring, respectively {% cite Grimson2007 Bartel2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Many target sites are well conserved among closely related species {% cite Friedman2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. However, there are many approaches to define \"well conserved\" targets. For instance, some use perfect seed matches among several species {% cite Krek2005 Enright2003 Lall2006 -f {{ bib }} %}, whereas others use pre-defined conservation scores calculated by global phylogenetic analysis {% cite Betel2010 Kertesz2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. Moreover, even though many targets are well conserved, some targets are also species-specific. For instance, one study predicted that about 30% of all experimentally validated targets are poorly conserved {% cite Sethupathy2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. The site accessibility of miRISC can be measured by computing the secondary structure of target sites through minimum free energy approaches. The site accessibility is potentially a very strong feature to predict true miRNA target sites because it is directly linked to target recognition. However, the precise mechanism of miRISC access on its targets is unknown, and developing a precise prediction model with mRNA secondary structure calculation usually requires huge computational power. Some models used elaborate two step approaches with the first step as initial forming of miRNA:mRNA complex, and the second step as hybrid elongation to form the complete miRNA:mRNA complex {% cite Kertesz2007 Long2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. An alternative feature to site accessibility is to measure the occurrence of AU rich elements both upstream and downstream of the seed site {% cite Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. Thermodynamic stabilities of AU base pairs are much lower than that of GC base pairs, and it can be a reason that sites surrounded by AU-rich context has better site accessibility for miRISCs. Moreover, this AU rich approach is computationally inexpensive with a good prediction performance {% cite Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. Scoring AU context is a more reliable measurement of target accessibility than any other currently available models with mRNA secondary structure calculation {% cite Bartel2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Multiple target sites enhance miRNA target efficacy {% cite John2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. Although the general effect of multiple sites is additive, the effect can be synergistic when two miRNA targets are within optimal distance. One reported such optimal distance is defined as two seed sites separated by between 13 and 35 nt {% cite Saetrom2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. For example, a gene with two 7mers within optimal distance is more down-regulated than a gene with a single 8mer. However, the effect is not apparent when two 7mers are not within optimal distance. In this case, a gene with 8mer is more down-regulated than a gene with two 7mers {% cite Bartel2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. To summarize miRNA target recognition and efficacy, most animal miRNAs bind on the 3' region of their target mRNAs by base paring. The seed site, which is located at position 2 to 7 of the miRNA, is usually used for this base paring, and the seed type tends to be one of the most important features. There are also other additional features that can contribute to target recognition and efficacy, such as 3' additional paring, site conservation, site accessibility, and cooperability of multiple target sites. ## 3.6 MicroRNA binding also occurs outside of the 3' UTR {#T:3.6} Although the precise regulatory mechanism of miRISC's binding on the 3' UTR is unclear, it may cause deadenylation, decapping, and exonucleolytic digestion of the mRNA {% cite Behm-Ansmant2006a Giraldez2006 Wu2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. Moreover, miRISCs bind other regions that reside outside of 3' UTRs, such as CDS {% cite Hafner2010 -f {{ bib }} %}, 5' UTR {% cite Lee2009 Hafner2010 -f {{ bib }} %}, and promoter regions {% cite Kim2008 Place2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Many miRNAs bind CDS regions; however, most of the sites are likely non-functional because ribosomes seem to detach miRISCs from their binding site while moving along the CDS region for translation {% cite Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. Nonetheless, there are several evidences that some miRNA target sites in CDS are functional. One example is that rare codons in CDS regions tend to make ribosomes stalled, and miRNA target sites right after these codons can be functional {% cite Gu2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Moreover, some target sites experimentally validated in CDS tend to have one very strong site {% cite Duursma2008 Elcheva2009 -f {{ bib }} %}, or multiple sites within optimal distance {% cite Forman2008 Tay2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Some miRNAs also target 5' UTR regions, though it is much less common than 3' UTR and CDS regions {% cite Bartel2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. One intriguing class of miRNA targets involved in 5' UTR is miBridge targets {% cite Lee2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. The miBridge target is a miRNA target site that has a normal seed site on the 3' UTR and a 5' portion paring on the 5' UTR simultaneously. One possible explanation for the regulation of miBridge is that miBridge is involved in the translational initiation by preventing ribosome scanning through the 5' UTR {% cite Lee2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. MicroRNA regulation can also occur inside the nucleus despite that miRNA's major regulatory roles are in the cytoplasm {% cite Hwang2007 Politz2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. The miRNA regulation in the nucleus is likely at the transcriptional level rather than the translational level. Several studies reported that miRNAs cause transcriptional silencing by targeting promoter regions {% cite Kim2008 Place2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. ## 3.7 Some of coding and non-coding pairs of cis-NATs potentially may have regulatory interactions with miRNAs {#T:3.7} A complex locus is a locus that contains several genes that interact among each other {% cite Engstrom2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. Two major classes of complex loci are cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs) and bi-directionally promoters (Fig. [3.4](#F:3.4)) {% cite Engstrom2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. Many complex loci have important regulatory roles, even though the precise mechanism is unknown {% cite Duhig1998 Holmes2003 -f {{ bib }} %}. ### &nbsp; {#F:3.4} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 3.4]({{ fig3_4 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig3_4[1] }}\"} #### **Figure 3.4**. Complex loci. {: .no_toc .text-caption } Complex loci consist of multiple genes that interact among each other. Two major classes of complex loci are cis-NATs and bi-directional promoters. Cis-NATs can be divided into three categories depending on the directions of the overlaps. \"Head to Head\" is that sense and antisense transcripts are partially overlapped on their 5' ends. \"Tail to Tail\" is that sense and antisense transcripts are partially overlapped on their 3' ends. \"Full overlap\" is that one transcript is fully overlapped with the other transcript. Bi-directional promoters reside between two genes arranged head-to-head on opposite strands with less than 1000 base pairs separating their transcription start sites {% cite Trinklein2004a -f {{ bib }} %}. {: .fs-2 } --- Cis-NATs is a sense-antisense pair of transcripts that are partially overlapping in the same locus {% cite Wang2005 -f {{ bib }} %}. Cis-NATs are relatively common in many species, and they are quite abundant in human {% cite Chen2004 Engstrom2006 Zhang2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. Three major classes, or orientations, of cis-NATs are \"head to head\", \"tail to tail\", and \"full overlap\" (Fig. [3.4](#F:3.4)) {% cite Osato2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. Although the molecular mechanism of cis-NAT regulation is poorly understood, three models may explain the potential cis-NAT regulation {% cite Osato2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. The first model is the transcriptional collision model {% cite Osato2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, which can be the main mechanism for \"head to head\" cis-NATs. The second model is the dsRNA formation model of sense and antisense transcripts {% cite Osato2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. One study showed that an endogenous ncRNA derived from a cis-NAT pair regulates its anti-sense transcript of a protein coding gene in plants {% cite Borsani2005 -f {{ bib }} %}. The third model is that cis-NATs are involved in epigenetic regulation. This model is based on the evidence that some ncRNAs are involved in the modification of chromatin structure and DNA methylation in the promoter region {% cite Tufarelli2003 Beisel2011 -f {{ bib }} %}. Bi-directional promoters reside between two genes arranged head-to-head on opposite strands with less than 1000 base pairs separating their transcription start sites {% cite Trinklein2004a -f {{ bib }} %}. Many pairs from bi-directional promoters are co-expressed, but some are antiregulated {% cite Trinklein2004a -f {{ bib }} %}. Bi-directional promoters are abundant; for instance, they represent approximately 10% of all the genes in human {% cite Trinklein2004a -f {{ bib }} %}. The main objective of the third sub-goal: *[miRNA and other ncRNAs]({{ path_ncrna }}/)* is to investigate potential miRNA interactions with other ncRNAs. Of these classes of complex loci, some miRNAs potentially interact with ncRNA:mRNA pairs of cis-NATs. In this case, miRNAs indirectly regulate the expression of the mRNAs in cis-NATs through directly regulating their paired ncRNAs (Fig. [3.5](#F:3.5)). Bi-directional promoters may also have ncRNA:mRNA pairs that potentially involve miRNAs regulation. Annotated data of bi-directional promoters are available for mRNA:mRNA pairs {% cite Engstrom2006 -f {{ bib }} %}, but there are few reliable data for ncRNA:mRNA pairs of bi-directional promoters. Therefore, we excluded bi-directional promoters and focused on cis-NATs, especially on ncRNA:mRNA pairs of cis-NATs, in the third sub-goal: *[miRNA and other ncRNAs]({{ path_ncrna }}/)*. ### &nbsp; {#F:3.5} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 3.5]({{ fig3_5 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig3_5[1] }}\"} #### **Figure 3.5**. miRNA regulation on cis-NAT. {: .no_toc .text-caption } The figure illustrates two different potential modes of miRNA regulation on cis-NATs. Direct miRNA regulation is a normal regulatory mode of miRNAs, in which miRNA binds on the 3' UTR of mRNA. Indirect mode is that miRNA regulates the protein coding mRNA in cis-NAT indirectly through binding the non-coding transcript. {: .fs-2 } --- ## 3.8 Chromatin associated RNAs are potentially associated with the modification of chromatin structure {#T:3.8} Chromatin associated RNAs (CARs) are experimentally validated non-coding RNAs that can bind a part of the chromatin directly {% cite Mondal2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. Since CARs affect their host and neighboring genes {% cite Mondal2010 -f {{ bib }} %}, CARs can be seen as a class of complex loci. CARs are likely involved in the regulation of chromatin structure by recruiting chromatin-modifying complexes (Fig. [3.6](#F:3.6)). This scenario is supported by the evidence that long ncRNAs regulate chromatin modification by guiding chromatin remodeling complexes to specific genome loci {% cite Mercer2009 Whitehead2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. In addition to long ncRNAs, RNAi is also known to have roles in the regulation of chromatin structure. For instance, in fission yeast, CARs serve as assembly platform to the RNA-induced initiation of transcriptional gene-silencing (RITS) complex. In this case of fission yeast, siRNAs associate with AGO1 and guide the RITS complex to CARs {% cite Beisel2011 -f {{ bib }} %}. Similar to ncRNA:mRNA pairs of cis-NATs, CARs potentially have interactions with miRNAs, though there is currently no strong evidence to support this. Therefore, we chose cis-NATs and CARs to investigate their potential interactions with miRNAs in the third sub-goal: *[miRNA and other ncRNAs]({{ path_ncrna }}/)*. ### &nbsp; {#F:3.6} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 3.6]({{ fig3_6 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig3_6[1] }}\"} #### **Figure 3.6**. CARs. {: .no_toc .text-caption } Upper panel shows a protein complex, a CAR, and nucleosomes. The complementary DNA region to the CAR is indicated in red. Lower panel shows one example of the CAR regulation to the chromatin. The CAR acts as a guide for the protein complex that can modify the chromatin structure. {: .fs-2 } --- ## References {#S:3.9} {% bibliography --cited_in_order -f {{ bib }} %} ",

TOC {:toc} --- Emerging high-throughput technologies have enabled genome-wide analyses of various biological data, such as different cell lines, tissues, and species, under different conditions. This chapter explains several high-throughput technologies for transcriptomic and proteomic analyses used in our research. We used both microarray and quantitative proteomics data to achieve all three sub-goals, but we used next generation sequence data only for the second and third sub-goals: *[miRNA high-throughput experiments]({{ path_experiment }}/)*, and *[miRNA and other ncRNAs]({{ path_ncrna }}/)*. ## 4.1 One microarray experiment can detect thousands of gene expressions simultaneously {#S:4.1} Microarrays can capture the expression levels of many genes in a single set of experiments. The microarray technology enables a high-throughput transcriptome-wide analysis, which is hard to achieve with other techniques for gene expression analyses, such as Northern blot {% cite Alwine1977 -f {{ bib }} %} or reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) {% cite Becker-Andre1989 Noonan1990 -f {{ bib }} %}. The Northern blot is a qualitative but low-throughput technique that requires the use of electrophoresis and large amounts of the input RNA {% cite Morozova2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. RT-qPCR can achieve higher throughput levels with less amount of the input RNA than Northern blot, but the throughput remains on the order of hundreds of known transcripts at a time {% cite Morozova2009 VanGuilder2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Although several types of microarray technologies exist, the DNA microarray is usually used for the transcriptome analysis. One microarray chip usually consists of thousands of spots, and each spot contains DNA oligonucleotides of a specific sequence {% cite Quackenbush2006d -f {{ bib }} %}. These DNA oligonucleotides are suitable for hybridization with DNA or RNA isolated from cells. Isolated RNAs are chemically labeled before hybridization. These labels, such as fluorescence dyes, are used to detect signal intensities of spots and determine the relative mRNA abundance among samples. One of the major DNA microarray applications is to measure the relative difference of mRNA abundance between two samples. For example, Figure [4.1](#F:4.1) shows the procedure of a two-color microarray system {% cite Quackenbush2006d -f {{ bib }} %}. Another popular microarray design is one-color microarray system, and data quality is essentially equivalent between one- and two-color approaches {% cite Patterson2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. ### &nbsp; {#F:4.1} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 4.1]({{ fig4_1 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig4_1[1] }}\"} #### **Figure 4.1**. Microarray procedure. {: .no_toc .text-caption } Two samples are compared by a two-color DNA microarray. Sample RNA represents a sample of interest, whereas Reference RNA represents a control sample for comparison. Sample RNA is dyed red by Cy5, and Reference RNA is dyed green by Cy3. These two samples are combined and hybridized with DNA oligonucleotides on the chip. Color intensity is measured to estimate relative RNA expression levels of the two samples. {: .fs-2 } --- After measuring the intensity levels, the raw data usually go through normalization and transformation {% cite Quackenbush2002 -f {{ bib }} %}, and this whole process is usually called the pre-processing of microarray data. The pre-processing of the raw data is very important to reduce the noise in each sample at the local level and among multiple samples at the global level. In addition to detecting relative RNA expression levels, the DNA microarray can be used for other applications, such as the detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and alternative splicing events {% cite Mockler2005 Morozova2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Two major drawbacks of microarray technologies are the limited ability to detect novel transcripts and noisy data even after pre-processing {% cite Morozova2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Nonetheless, the microarray technology is still widely used for many transcriptomics analyses because of the ability to measure the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously at relatively low cost. ## 4.2 The next generation sequencing methods are faster and more cost-effective than Sanger sequencing {#S:4.2} As an alternative approach to the microarray technology, DNA sequencing approaches are also widely used for transcriptome analysis. The advantage of these sequencing methods is the ability to identify new transcripts and measure the abundance of transcripts directly {% cite Morozova2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. First generation sequencing methods relied on the Sanger method {% cite Sanger1977 -f {{ bib }} %}. Since the original Sanger method uses the full-length complementary DNA (FLcDNA), it involves a complex *in vivo* cloning step that usually results in very high cost. Therefore, the original Sanger method is normally limited only to novel transcript discovery and annotation {% cite Morozova2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Two examples of Sanger method applications are expressed sequence tag (EST) {% cite Adams1991 -f {{ bib }} %} and Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) {% cite Velculescu1995 -f {{ bib }} %}. Both approaches use shorter tags, which are short sub-sequences of the cDNA sequence, rather than the FLcDNAs. ESTs are short tags generated from either 3' or 5' end of a cDNA clone. Even though the sequencing cost is reduced by ESTs compared with FLcDNAs, it is still too expensive for the whole transcriptome analysis {% cite Morozova2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. SAGE is a method that uses short tags generated from 3' ends of mRNA transcripts. SAGE is suitable for estimating transcript abundance due to high redundancy of sequencing reads {% cite Morozova2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. However, SAGE is still costly for the transcriptome analysis because it still relies on labor intensive *in vivo* cloning procedures {% cite Morozova2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. The next generation, or the second generation, sequencing methods have substantially improved upon the Sanger method. They produce millions of short reads in a relatively short period of time {% cite Voelkerding2010 -f {{ bib }} %} depending on several criteria, such as read length, sequence coverage, and the size of the genome of interest (Table [4.1](#T:4.1)). The reads are assembled computationally afterwards if necessary. The major contribution to this enhancement is to parallelize the sequencing process {% cite Hall2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, though other features, such as the usage of PCR-based amplification instead of costly and labor intensive *in vivo* cloning, also contribute {% cite Morozova2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Three popular commercially available next generation sequencing technologies are, Roche 454 ([http://454.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/454_Life_Sciences)), Illumina (), and Applied Biosystems SOLiD () (Table [4.1](#T:4.1)). The second generation sequencing can be used for all the applications that are based on the Sanger method, including EST and SAGE. Some applications that are based on the second generation sequencing are explained in the next section. ### **Table 4.1**. Next generation sequencing technologies. {#T:4.1} {: .no_toc .text-caption } The table shows three examples of commercially available next generation sequencing technologies with specifications obtained from their corresponding web sites as of March 2011. \"bp\" and \"Gb\" represent base pairs and giga base pairs respectively. The product type with the best specification is selected for each technology. Both 2 × n and n × m represent the read length of the pair end approach where n and m are read lengths in base pairs. {: .fs-2 } | **Roche 454** | **Illumina** | **SOLiD** |-------------------------|----------------|--------------|----------------| **Product type** | GS FLX | HiSeq 2000 | 5500xl | **Read length** | 400 bp | 1 × 35 bp | 75 bp | | 2 × 50 bp | 75 bp × 35 bp | | 2 × 100 bp | 60 bp × 60 bp | **Throughput per day** | 1 Gb | 25 Gb | 20-30 Gb | --- Third generation sequencing techniques will be available in the near future. The main feature of the third generation is the ability to sequence the whole single molecule instead of breaking down the molecule into short reads, therefore the read lengths should be much longer than those of the second generation sequencing technologies. Several strong candidates that may lead the third generation sequencing are Pacific Bioscience SMRT Sequencing (), Oxford Nanopore technologies (), and Life technologies Single Molecule Sequencing (). ## 4.3 The second generation sequencing technologies can cover a wide range of applications {#S:4.3} The second generation sequencing can be used in many different applications because of its high-throughput and cost effectiveness. For example, the applications can be transcript rearrangement discovery, single-nucleotide variation profiling, and non-coding RNA discovery {% cite Morozova2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Two such applications, RNA-Seq and CLIP (Cross-Linking and ImmunoPrecipitation)-Seq, are very powerful and useful for transcriptomic analyses. RNA-Seq or the whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (WTSS) is a technique that uses the second generation sequencing technology to produce sequence reads at the whole transcriptome level {% cite Morin2008 Nagalakshmi2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Since the second generation sequencing technology can yield sufficient sequencing depth, which represents the total number of sequence reads generated from a sequencing library {% cite Morozova2009 -f {{ bib }} %}, RNA-Seq can be used for gene expression profiling with high accuracy. CLIP-Seq {% cite Sanford2009 -f {{ bib }} %}, also called HITS-CLIP (High throughput sequencing CLIP) {% cite Licatalosi2008 -f {{ bib }} %}, is a technique that employs three important steps, cross-linking, immunoprecipitation, and next generation sequencing. It can be used to tag and pull-down RNA-interacting proteins of interest and infer the interactions between RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Firstly, RNA binding proteins and their target RNA regions are cross-linked by ultraviolet (UV) light, and the antibodies for the proteins are used for immunoprecipitation {% cite Jensen2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Subsequently, the RNA transcripts pulled down with the proteins go through the second generation sequencing procedure {% cite Sanford2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. RIP (Ribonucleoprotein ImmunoPrecipitation)-Seq is similar to CLIP-Seq {% cite Wong2009b -f {{ bib }} %}, but it uses chemical cross-linkers such as formaldehyde instead of UV cross-linking {% cite Niranjanakumari2002 Conrad2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. This cross-linking is reversible, and it is subject to potential reassociation between RNAs and RNA-binding proteins after cell lysis in some cases {% cite Mili2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. ## 4.4 Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is a powerful tool to analyze quantitative proteomics {#S:4.4} In recent years, several new technologies for the identification and quantification of proteins have emerged. Most of them are based on mass-spectrometry (MS), which is a technique that ionizes molecules and measures the mass-to-charge ratio by detecting them in an electromagnetic field {% cite Boggess2001 -f {{ bib }} %}. Although there are many variants of MS-based technologies {% cite Mallick2010 -f {{ bib }} %}, the Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) {% cite Ong2002 -f {{ bib }} %} approach is widely used in detecting protein expression profiles. LC-MS/MS uses high-performance liquid chromatography that can separate a mixture of molecules with very small particles and a high pressure before the MS/MS phase. MS/MS, or tandem mass spectrometry, involves two steps of MS selections. The first MS can be used for the quantification of peptides, and the second MS can be used for the identification of the peptides {% cite Mallick2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. LC-MS/MS is usually combined with either labeling or labeling-free methods for a quantification approach. For example, SILAC tends to be used for small changes (10%-50%), and isotope tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), which is another labeling method, tends to be used for moderate changes (50%-200%) {% cite Mallick2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. Moreover, a labeling-free method using spectrum counts can be used for large changes (>100%) {% cite Mallick2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. Among them, SILAC is a simple but very powerful method for quantitative proteomics {% cite Ong2005 -f {{ bib }} %}. The SILAC procedure uses two different stable amino acid isotopes, as \"light\" and \"heavy\" labels. The relative abundance of proteins can be detected by comparing the intensities of isotope clusters {% cite Mallick2010 Ong2005 -f {{ bib }} %}. The coverage of protein identification in the genome is usually less than 10% for higher organisms {% cite Bantscheff2007a -f {{ bib }} %} due to enormous molecular complexity and the dynamic nature of proteins, such as post-translational modifications and protein stability {% cite Mallick2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. However, the protein coverage of quantification is even lower than the protein identification. One possible explanation for this low coverage is that protein quantification requires much higher data quality, in terms of information content, than protein identification {% cite Bantscheff2007a -f {{ bib }} %}. ## 4.5 Most preprocessed and raw data sets from high-throughput experiments are publicly available {#S:4.5} Two major repositories for microarray experiment data are ArrayExpress () {% cite Parkinson2011 -f {{ bib }} %} at European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) () {% cite Barrett2006 -f {{ bib }} %} at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Both repositories encourage submitters to supply Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) {% cite Brazma2001 -f {{ bib }} %} compliant data. MIAME is a standard for the microarray data formats. caption The major repository for the next generation sequencing data is the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), which is operated by the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) {% cite Leinonen2011 -f {{ bib }} %}. However, due to a rapid growth of next generation sequencing data and budget constrains, NCBI, which is the main member of INSDS, currently accepts limited types and forms of the next generation sequencing data. There are no central repositories for quantitative proteomics data, but many small and medium scale public repositories are available instead. Some of the examples of such repositories {% cite Mead2009 -f {{ bib }} %} are Proteomics IDEntifications database (PRIDE) {% cite Jones2006 -f {{ bib }} %}, the Global Proteome Machine database (GPMDB) {% cite Craig2004 -f {{ bib }} %}, and PeptideAtlas {% cite Deutsch2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. ## References {#S:4.6} {% bibliography --cited_in_order -f {{ bib }} %} ",

TOC {:toc} --- This chapter describes various statistical methods used in our research. We used basic statistical methods, such as parametric tests and correlation, to achieve all three sub-goals of our research, but we used multiple non-parametric tests only for the second and third sub-goals: *[miRNA high-throughput experiments]({{ path_experiment }}/)*, and *[miRNA and other ncRNAs]({{ path_ncrna }}/)*. Moreover, we mainly used the resampling approach to achieve the third sub-goal: *[miRNA and other ncRNAs]({{ path_ncrna }}/)*. ## 5.1 Parametric statistics: Parameters and Hypothesis testing {#S:5.1} Statistics tests play important roles in biology to analyze different kinds of data from biological experiments. Most analyses in biology use parametric statistics, which can be used only when the data are likely from a known distribution with parameters. The most commonly used parametric distribution is the normal distribution, which has two parameters: $$\\mu$$ (mean) and $$\\sigma^{2}$$ (variance). Mean is a measure of central tendency, whereas variance is a measure of spread. Standard deviation ($$\\sigma$$), which is the square root of variance, is also a measure of spread. The normal distribution is defined by its probability density function {% cite Rosner2006 -f {{ bib }} %} as: $$\\label{eq_norm} f(x) = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}}. \\tag{5.1}$$ The parametric statistics offers various analysis methods, but the most common method is hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing is that the null hypothesis, denoted by H0, is tested to infer whether the alternative hypothesis, denoted by H1, is true or false. The alternative hypothesis contradicts the null hypothesis in some sense {% cite Rosner2006 -f {{ bib }} %}, therefore, if H0 is rejected, H1 is inferred as \"True\", whereas if H0 is accepted, H1 is inferred as \"False\". The p-value is the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. For example, the p-value 0.05 means that there is 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. Two significance levels, 0.05 and 0.01, are commonly used as statistically \"significant\" or \"highly significant\". Moreover, two types of errors may occur when the null hypothesis is either accepted or rejected (Table [5.1](#T:5.1)). Type I error is the error of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, whereas Type II error is the error of accepting the null hypothesis when it is false. Type I error is more important for hypothesis testing because the p-value is equivalent to the probability of Type I error. ### **Table 5.1**. Four possible outcomes of hypothesis testing. {#T:5.1} {: .no_toc .text-caption } The table shows the four possible outcomes of hypothesis testing with two error types. {: .fs-2 } | H0 is true | H1 is true |+---------------------------+|+--------------------------------------+|+--------------------------------------+| Accept H0 | True Negative | False Negative (Type II error) | Reject H0 | False Positive (Type I error) | True Positive | --- For analysis of biological data, one of the most common methods for hypothesis testing is two sample inference. For example, when two samples, $$x_{1}$$ and $$x_{2}$$, are normally distributed with equal variance, the test statistic $$t$$ {% cite Rosner2006 -f {{ bib }} %} is: $$\\label{eq_stu_t} t = \\dfrac{\\overline{x}_{1}-\\overline{x}_{2}}{S\\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{n_{1}}+\\dfrac{1}{n_{2}}}}, \\tag{5.2}$$ where $$S = \\sqrt{((n_{1}-1)s_{1}^{2}+(n_{2}-1)s_{2}^{2})/(n_{1}+n_{2}-2)}$$, $$n_{1}$$ and $$n_{2}$$ are sample size of $$x_{1}$$ and $$x_{2}$$, and $$s_{1}$$ and $$s_{2}$$ are standard deviation of $$x_{1}$$ and $$x_{2}$$. The test statistics enables to determine the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis, hence the p-value can be calculated from the test statistics. The calculation method of the test statistics varies depending on the type of distributions and the properties of the samples. In the example above, the test statistic $$t$$ follows Student's t distribution. This test is called two sample Student's t-test, and it is used when the variances need to be calculated directly from the samples. ## 5.2 Non-parametric statistical methods: Wilcoxon rank-sum and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests {#S:5.2} The parametric statistical methods are valid only when the samples of interest follow known distributions with parameters. However, the original distributions of samples are quite often unknown, therefore, non-parametric statistical methods should be used in these cases. Non-parametric methods tend to be more robust, and their applicability is much wider than corresponding parametric methods because they need fewer assumptions. However, they require a larger sample size to draw the same conclusion of their corresponding parametric methods because they usually have less statistical power. One of the most commonly used non-parametric statistical methods is the Wilcoxon rank-sum test {% cite Mann1947 Wilcoxon1945 -f {{ bib }} %}, which is a two sample non-parametric test when the samples are independent. It uses a ranking procedure, in which individual values are ordered and ranked. There are two approaches, the Mann-Whitney U-test and the normal approximation, to calculate the test statistics for the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. (i) The Mann-Whitney U-test {% cite Mann1947 -f {{ bib }} %} is used to test whether two samples are drawn from the same distribution. The U value for the U-test is calculated from the sum of the ranks and the sample size. For example, the $$U$$ value for sample $$x$$, denoted as $$U_{x}$$, is calculated as $$U_{x}=R_{x}-n_{x}(n_{x}+1)/2$$ where $$R_{x}$$ is the sum of the ranks of $$x$$, and $$n_{x}$$ is the sample size of $$x$$. (ii) The normal approximation can be used instead of the U-test when the sample size is large enough (>10) for both samples {% cite Rosner2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. The test statistics T for two independent samples, $$x$$ and $$y$$, is: $$\\label{eq_wc} T = \\dfrac{\\left[ \\left| R_{1} - \\dfrac{n_{1}(n_{1}+n_{2}+1)}{2} \\right| - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\right]}{\\sqrt{\\left( \\dfrac{n_{1}n_{2}}{12} \\right) (n_{1}+n_{2}+1))}}, \\tag{5.3}$$ where $$R_{x}$$ is the sum of the ranks of $$x$$, and $$n_{x}$$ and $$n_{y}$$ are the sample size of $$x$$ and $$y$$. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test) is a non-parametric statistical method that does not use ranking procedures. For instance, the two sample K-S test is used to infer whether two continuous distributions differ. The K-S test requires two continuous distribution functions, $$F(x)$$ and $$G(y)$$ where the two distributions are defined as $$X_{1} \\ldots X_{m}$$ with the size $$m$$, and $$Y_{1} \\ldots Y_{n}$$ with the size $$n$$. In this case, however, both distributions are unknown. Therefore, empirical distribution functions, $$\\hat{F}(x)$$ and $$\\hat{G}(y)$$, are used instead. An empirical distribution function is a step function defined as {% cite Kvam2007 -f {{ bib }} %}: $$\\label{eq_empr} \\hat{F}_{n}(x) = \\dfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} I(X_{i} \\leq x), \\tag{5.4}$$ where $$I(X_{i} \\leq x)$$ is the indicator function, and is equal to 1 if $$X_{i} \\leq x$$ and 0 otherwise. The test statistics $$D$$ for the K-S test {% cite Arnold2005 -f {{ bib }} %} is: $$\\label{eq_ks} D = \\max_x | \\hat{F}(x) - \\hat{G}(x) |, \\tag{5.5}$$ for the hypothesis of this test: $$\\begin{array}{l l l} H_{0}: & F(x) = G(x) & \\textrm{for all $x$}, \\\\ H_{1}: & F(x) \\neq G(x) & \\textrm{for some $x$}. \\\\ \\end{array}$$ H0 is rejected at level $$\\alpha$$ when D is too large as in: $$\\label{eq_ks_d} \\dfrac{mn}{m+n}D > K_{\\alpha}, \\tag{5.6}$$ where the critical value of the Kolmogorov distribution, $$K_{\\alpha}$$, is found from $$P(K \\leq K_{\\alpha}) = 1 - \\alpha$$ {% cite Marsaglia2003 -f {{ bib }} %}. ## 5.3 Resampling: Bootstrap and Permutation test {#S:5.3} In statistics, resampling methods treat an observed sample as a finite population {% cite Rizzo2008 -f {{ bib }} %} and reuse the data of the observed sample. Resampling approaches have gained popularity in recent years because sufficient computational power has become available to make enough random samples to achieve robust statistical analysis {% cite Moore2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Three major applications of resampling are (i) the bootstrapping method as estimating the characteristics of the sample, (ii) the permutation test as exchanging labels to perform significant tests, and (iii) the cross validation approach as validating models by using random subsets. This section briefly explains two such applications, bootstrapping and permutation tests. Cross-validation is explained in the next chapter as an evaluation method for machine learning. Bootstrapping {% cite Efron1994 -f {{ bib }} %} is a resampling method that generates random samples from an observed sample with replacement. Sampling with replacement means that a randomly drawn observation should put back in the original sample before drawing the next one {% cite Moore2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Bootstrap is mainly used for estimating population characteristics by collecting the statistics from many resamples. Permutation tests are non-parametric procedures based on resampling. The tests randomly rearrange the data without replacement to create the sampling distribution of the test statistics under the null hypothesis {% cite Moore2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. To illustrate the basic idea of a permutation test, suppose we have two samples $$x$$ with size m and $$y$$ with size n. We first pool all the data points from $$x$$ and $$y$$, and randomly draw a point from this pooled set without replacement to make resample controls with size $$m$$ and $$n$$. We then iterate this resampling to make a permutation distribution. The number of resamples depends on a required statistical power, but 1000 is widely used. The p-value is calculated by comparing the parameter of the original observation with the permutation distribution of the parameter {% cite Moore2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. For instance, if 14 cases of 999 resamples are larger than the parameter of the original sample, the p-value of one-sided test can be calculated as: $$\\label{eq_pval_perm} \\dfrac{14+1}{999+1} = \\dfrac{15}{1000} = 0.015. \\tag{5.7}$$ Adding one to both numerator and denominator of Eq. \\eqref{eq_pval_perm} improves the estimate of the p-value. Moreover, Fisher's exact test {% cite Fisher1922 -f {{ bib }} %} is a special case of permutation test that is used in the analysis of categorical data, especially for contingency tables with small sample size. For instance, when the Fisher's exact test is used for a 2 × 2 table, it calculates the exact probability by considering all possible values under the assumption that the margins of the table are fixed {% cite Moore2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. ## 5.4 Multiple comparison tests: Analysis of variance, Bonferroni correction, and False discovery rate {#S:5.4} In addition to one and two sample inferences, multisample inference is also important in many biological analyses. Two major approaches for multisample inference are the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparison tests. The ANOVA test concerns the means of several groups, and its hypothesis is: $$\\begin{array}{l l} H_{0}: \\textrm{all means are equal}, \\\\ H_{1}: \\textrm{not all means are equal}. \\\\ \\end{array}$$ The F test can be used when each group follows a normal distribution, and the test statistics $$F$$ is: $$\\label{eq_ftest} F = \\dfrac{\\textrm{Between Mean Square}}{\\textrm{Within Mean Square}}. \\tag{5.8}$$ \"Between Mean Square\" measures the mean among the groups, whereas \"Within Mean Square\" measures the mean among individuals within the same group {% cite Moore2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. As for the non-parametric approach, the Kruskal-Wallis test {% cite Kruskal1952 -f {{ bib }} %} can be used if some group has no specific distribution. It is a non-parametric ANOVA test, and it uses ranking procedures as calculating the sums of the ranks for the groups {% cite Moore2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Multiple comparisons procedures enable to detect the groups that differ from the others. The most common approach of multiple comparisons is to simply compare all possible pairs by two sample inference, followed by p-value adjustment. The p-value adjustment is critical for multiple comparisons because some differences likely occur just by chance if there is a large number of groups, and every pair of groups should be compared {% cite Moore2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Many p-value correction methods have been developed for various cases, and most of them either change the significance level of the test, $$\\alpha$$, or consider the false discovery rate (FDR), which is (False Positive) / (False Positive + True Negative). The Bonferroni correction computes an alternative significance level, $$\\alpha^{*}$$, defined as {% cite Rosner2006 -f {{ bib }} %}: $$\\label{eq_bonf} \\alpha^{*} = \\dfrac{\\alpha}{\\binom{k}{2}}, \\tag{5.9}$$ where $$k$$ is the number of groups. For example, there are 45 possible pairs when $$k = 10$$, therefore $$\\alpha^{*} = \\alpha / 45$$. One critical problem of the Bonferroni correction is to control the overall experimental-wise type I error rate, hence, no significant pairs may be found when $$k$$ is very large. The FDR control, or the Benjamini and Hochberg correction {% cite Benjamini1995 -f {{ bib }} %}, is to modify p-values without controlling the overall experimental-wise type I error rate. The FDR aims to control the proportion of false-positive results {% cite Rosner2006 -f {{ bib }} %}, therefore, several significant pairs will be expected to be found. ## 5.5 Correlation: Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients {#S:5.5} In statistics, the correlation indicates the statistical relationships between two or more samples. The correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to 1, represents the degree of correlation. Samples are positively correlated, negatively correlated, and uncorrelated when the coefficient is greater than 0, less than 0, and exactly 0, respectively {% cite Rosner2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. It is also important to test the significance of correlation by determining whether an observed correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero or not. Pearson's correlation coefficient, usually denoted as $$r$$, indicates the linear relationships between two samples that follow normal distribution. For example, two samples, X and Y, have individual observations represented as $$x_{i}$$ and $$y_{i}$$ where i = 1, 2, \\..., n. The Pearson's correlation coefficient, $$r_{xy}$$, is {% cite Rosner2006 -f {{ bib }} %}: $$\\label{eq_pearson} r_{xy} = \\dfrac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\\bar{x})(y_{i}-\\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\\bar{x})^{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-\\bar{y})^{2}}}. \\tag{5.10}$$ This is equivalent to: $$r_{xy} = \\dfrac{s_{xy}}{s_{x}s_{y}} = \\dfrac{\\textrm{sample covariance between $x$ and $y$}}{(\\textrm{sample standard deviation of $x$})(\\textrm{sample standard deviation of $y$})}.$$ Spearman's correlation coefficient, denoted as $$\\rho$$, is a non-parametric method. Hence, it can be used when the distributions are unknown. The calculation of $$\\rho$$ is similar to that of $$r$$, but the ranks are used instead of the actual observation values {% cite Rosner2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. ## 5.6 Regression analysis: Multivariate linear regression {#S:5.6} Regression analysis is an important statistical method with biological data because it identifies the characteristics and relationships among multiple factors {% cite Schneider2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. Many types of regression analysis exist depending on different criteria such as univariate versus multivariate, or linear versus non-linear, for instance. Multivariate linear regression can be performed to study the effect of multiple variables and their linear relationships in the data. The linear regression model relating $$y$$ to $$x_{1}$$, \\..., $$x_{k}$$, is {% cite Rosner2006 -f {{ bib }} %}: $$\\label{eq_lreg} y = \\alpha + \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\beta_{j}x_{j} + e, \\tag{5.11}$$ where $$e$$ is an error term that is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $$\\sigma^{2}$$. The main goal of the regression analysis is to minimize $$e$$ and estimate the best $$\\alpha$$ and $$\\beta$$ to fit this model. The goodness of fit for a regression model indicates how well the observed data fit the predicted model. One of the approaches to measure the goodness of fit for multiple regression models is to perform residual analysis {% cite Rosner2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. Moreover, many procedures of regression analysis overlap with those of machine learning. Therefore, several machine learning evaluation methods are also useful to evaluate regression models. Some of these evaluation methods for machine learning are explained in the next chapter. ## References {#S:5.7} {% bibliography --cited_in_order -f {{ bib }} %} ",

TOC {:toc} --- The support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning technique that has been applied in numerous bioinformatics domains successfully in recent years {% cite Pavlidis2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. We used SVM as a machine learning model to achieve the first sub-goal of our research: *[miRNA target prediction]({{ path_prediction }}/)*. We built a binary classification model with both linear and non-linear approaches. Binary classification predicts only two class labels, positive/true or negative/false. This chapter describes the theoretical background for SVM, and data preparation and evaluation methods mainly for binary classification, followed by other machine learning algorithms for comparison. ## 6.1 Machine learning: Supervised and Unsupervised {#S:6.1} Machine learning (ML) techniques have two major paradigms, supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is used for discriminant analysis and regression analysis {% cite Tarca2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, and it requires a training process. The training data consists of multiple feature vectors and the class labels. The main purpose of the training process is to make a classifier that can predict appropriate class labels from the feature vectors of the test data. The test data consists of the same feature vectors as in the training data, but it has no class labels. Unsupervised learning requires no training process, and it categorizes unlabeled data. The main application of unsupervised learning is clustering. The aim of clustering is to divide the data into groups (clusters) using some measures of similarity {% cite Tarca2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. ## 6.2 SVM: Theory {#S:6.2} SVM is a state-of-the-art supervised machine learning method introduced by Boser, Guyon, and Vapnik in 1992 {% cite Boser1992 -f {{ bib }} %}. SVM is a linear binary classification method based on the Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) principle {% cite Vapnik1982 -f {{ bib }} %}. Two essential ideas of SRM are the bound on the generalization performance of a learning machine and the Vapnik Chervonenkis (VC) dimension {% cite Vapnik1998 -f {{ bib }} %}. The aim of SRM is to find a hypothesis $$h$$ that has the guaranteed lowest probability of error $$Err(h)$$ from a hypothesis space $$H$$ {% cite Joachims2002 -f {{ bib }} %}. In other words, SRM finds the best machine learning model, $$\\alpha$$, that has lowest test error rate, $$R(\\alpha)$$, where $$R(\\alpha)$$ is equivalent with $$Err(h)$$. The upper bound of the test error can guarantee the performance of a learning machine, and the bound holds with a probability of at least $$1-\\eta$$ for a given training sample with $$n$$ examples {% cite Burges1998 -f {{ bib }} %}: $$\\label{eq_rm_bound} R(\\alpha) \\leq R_{emp}(\\alpha) + \\displaystyle \\sqrt{\\dfrac{d(\\log(2n/d)+1)-\\log(\\eta)}{4}}, \\tag{6.1}$$ where $$R_{emp}(\\alpha)$$ is a training error rate, and $$d$$ is a VC dimension. The VC dimension is a measure of capacity for the data point separation by hyperplanes, and this separation is called shattering. A hyperplane in Euclidean space can separate the space into two half spaces, and it is a subset of $$n-1$$ dimension for an $$n$$-dimensional space. For example, a straight line is a hyperplane of a two-dimensional Euclidean space, whereas a flat-plane is a hyperplane of a three-dimensional Euclidean space. The VC dimension varies depending on the selection of a machine learning model. For example, the VC dimension of the set of oriented hyperplanes in $$\\mathbf{R}^{n}$$ is $$n+1$$ for a simple linear binary classifier, such as perceptron. Accordingly, Eq. \\eqref{eq_rm_bound} reflects a trade-off between the training error, $$R_{emp}(\\alpha)$$, and the complexity of hypothesis space estimated by the VC-dimension of a learning machine {% cite Joachims2002 -f {{ bib }} %}. SVMs solve this trade-off problem by keeping the VC-dimension low through maximizing the margin of boundaries. A SVM can be defined as a linear binary classifier: $$\\label{eq_binary_lnr} f(\\mathbf{x}) = sign(\\mathbf{w^{T}x} + b) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l l l} +1 & \\mathrm{if} & \\mathbf{w^{T}x} + b > 0\\\\ -1 & \\mathrm{else} & \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. , \\tag{6.2}$$ where $$w$$ is a weight vector and $$b$$ is a threshold. The margin of this classifier, $$\\delta$$, is a length between a boundary hyperplanes, either $$\\mathbf{w^{T}x} + b = +1$$ or $$\\mathbf{w^{T}x} + b = -1$$, and the optimal hyperplane, $$\\mathbf{w^{T}x} + b = 0$$. The margin is calculated as: $$\\label{eq_margin} \\delta = \\dfrac{1}{||\\mathbf{w}||}. \\tag{6.3}$$ Vapnik proved that the VC dimension $$d$$ for such a classifier defined in Eq. \\eqref{eq_binary_lnr} is bounded by {% cite Vapnik1982 -f {{ bib }} %}: $$\\label{eq_vcdimen} d \\leq \\min \\left( \\left[ \\dfrac{\\mathbf{R}^{2}}{\\delta^{2}} \\right], N \\right) + 1, \\tag{6.4}$$ when this classifier is in an $$N$$ dimensional space, and all example vectors, $$\\mathbf{x}_{1}, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_{n}$$, are inside a ball of diameter $$\\mathbf{R}$$. It indicates that a SVM classifier keeps the VC-dimension lower by maximizing the margin of the boundaries between two hyperplanes. This is the mathematical background to guarantee that SVM has an upper bound of the test error rate even with very large feature vectors since the number of feature vectors has very small influence on the VC-dimension with SVM. ## 6.3 SVM: Linear SVM {#S:6.3} The aim of SRM is to find an optimal hyperplane than can maximize the right term of Eq. \\eqref{eq_rm_bound}. SVM is based on SRM, and its solution is to make a classifier as Eq. \\eqref{eq_binary_lnr} with the maximum margin of Eq. \\eqref{eq_margin}. In other words, from many boundaries that can separate two classes (Fig. [6.1](#F:6.1)A), the SVM finds the optimal hyperplane where the margin of the boundary between two hyperplanes, $$\\mathbf{w^{T}x} + b = +1$$ and $$\\mathbf{w^{T}x} + b = -1$$ becomes the maximum (Fig. [6.1](#F:6.1)B). Because it is difficult to solve this maximum margin problem directly, this problem is usually translated into the quadratic optimization problem {% cite Joachims2002 -f {{ bib }} %}. Quadratic programming (QP) is a class of optimization algorithms to either minimize or maximize a quadratic function subject to linear constrains. For SVM, finding a solution in the prime form of QP defined in Eq. \\eqref{eq_s_prime} is equivalent to finding the optimal hyperplane with the maximum margin. The training data of this SVM are $$(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)$$ for $$\\forall i$$ where $$\\mathbf{x}_i$$ is a feature vector with $$N$$ dimensions as $$\\mathbf{x}_i \\in \\mathbf{R}^{N}$$, and $$y_i$$ is a class label as $$y_i \\in \\{-1,+1\\}$$. $$\\label{eq_s_prime} \\begin{array}{l l} \\underset{\\mathbf{w},b}{\\text{minimize}} & \\dfrac{1}{2}||\\mathbf{w}||^{2} \\\\ \\text{subject to}: &y_{i}(\\mathbf{w^{T}x}_{i} + b) \\geq 1, \\forall i. \\end{array} \\tag{6.5}$$ ### &nbsp; {#F:6.1} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 6.1]({{ fig6_1 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig6_1[1] }}\"} #### **Figure 6.1**. SVM hyperplanes and maximum margin. {: .no_toc .text-caption } The figure shows the relationship between hyperplanes and the maximum margin of SVM. Red circle and blue square dots represent data points with negative and positive labels. **(A)** Many hyperplanes can separate two classes. **(B)** Three lines represent hyperplanes with the optimal hyperplane in the middle. The margin is a distance between two hyperplanes, $$\\mathbf{w^{T}x} + b = +1$$ and $$\\mathbf{w^{T}x} + b = -1$$. $$\\mathbf{w}$$ is a weight vector. {: .fs-2 } --- However, this prime form of QP (Eq. \\ref{eq_s_dual}) is still numerically difficult to handle {% cite Joachims2002 -f {{ bib }} %}, therefore, it can be further transformed into the dual form: $$\\label{eq_s_dual} \\begin{array}{l l} \\underset{\\alpha}{\\text{maximize}} & \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\alpha_{i} - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\displaystyle \\sum_{j=1}^{n} y_{i}y_{j}\\alpha_{i}\\alpha_{j}\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\\mathbf{T}}\\mathbf{x}_{j}\\\\ \\text{subject to}: & \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i}\\alpha_{i} = 0, 0 \\leq \\alpha_{i} \\end{array} \\tag{6.6}$$ Support vectors are vectors such that their corresponding $$\\alpha$$ values are non-zero in this dual form. SVMs only use these support vectors when classifying the test data. The dot product of $$\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\\mathbf{T}}\\mathbf{x}_{j}$$ can be used for the kernel trick that enables SVMs to solve non-linear problems {% cite Smola2003 -f {{ bib }} %}. In many cases, SVMs can find no hyperplanes that separate two classes, therefore, the slack variables, $$\\xi$$, are introduced to allow some misclassified data points {% cite Joachims2002 -f {{ bib }} %}. The SVM with $$\\xi_{i}$$ is called a soft-margin SVM {% cite Cortes1995 -f {{ bib }} %}, and its prime form is: $$\\label{eq_s_prime_c} \\begin{array}{l l} \\underset{\\mathbf{w},b}{\\text{minimize}} & \\dfrac{1}{2}||\\mathbf{w}||^{2} + C \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\xi_{i} \\\\ \\text{subject to}: &y_{i}(\\mathbf{w^{T}x}_{i} + b) \\geq 1 - \\xi_{i}, \\xi_{i} \\geq 0, \\forall i, \\end{array} \\tag{6.7}$$ where $$C$$ is the cost factor that controls the training error rate. Small $$C$$ allows many misclassified points (Fig. [6.2](#F:6.2)A), whereas large $$C$$ allows few misclassified points between the boundaries (Fig. [6.2](#F:6.2)B). ### &nbsp; {#F:6.2} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 6.2]({{ fig6_2 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig6_2[1] }}\"} #### **Figure 6.2**.Linear kernel with soft margin. {: .no_toc .text-caption } The figure shows two examples of different soft margin constants. Red circle and blue square dots represent data points with negative and positive labels, respectively. Three lines represent hyperplanes with the optimal hyperplane in the middle. The gray scale in the background indicates discriminant values. The darker indicates the smaller in negative values, whereas the lighter indicates the greater in positive values. **(A)** $$C = 1$$. **(B)** $$C = 250$$. In this example, SVM(A), the SVM in panel A, misclassifies one point, whereas SVM(B), the SVM in panel B, classifies all points correctly. However, SVM(A) found a better hyperplane between the overall trends in circle and square classes than SVM(B). SVM(B) has a much smaller margin to the circle class than SVM(A). {: .fs-2 } --- ## 6.4 SVM: Non-linear SVM {#S:6.4} SVMs can use a kernel function to solve non-linear problems. When the feature vectors are mapped to a high dimensional ($$>d$$) feature space, $$\\mathcal{H}$$, from the original $$d$$-dimensional feature space, $$\\mathbf{R}^{d}$$, a non-linear separation in $$\\mathbf{R}^{d}$$ becomes a linear separation in $$\\mathcal{H}$$ (Fig. [6.3](#F:6.3)) {% cite Kotsiantis2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. The non-linear mapping function is defined as: $$\\label{eq_hilbert} \\Phi: \\mathbf{R}^{d} \\mapsto \\mathcal{H}. \\tag{6.8}$$ The dot product, $$\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\\mathbf{T}}\\mathbf{x}_{j}$$, in Eq. \\eqref{eq_s_dual} can be replaced by a kernel function defined as: $$\\label{eq_kerneltr} K(\\mathbf{x}_{i},\\mathbf{x}_{j}) = \\Phi(\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\\mathbf{T}}) \\cdot \\Phi(\\mathbf{x}_{j}). \\tag{6.9}$$ Two commonly used non-linear kernel functions {% cite Tarca2007 -f {{ bib }} %} are Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF): $$\\label{eq_rbk} K(\\mathbf{x}_{i},\\mathbf{x}_{j}) = \\exp(-\\gamma||\\mathbf{x}_{i} - \\mathbf{x}_{j}||^{2}),\\tag{6.10}$$ and Polynomial: $$\\label{eq_poli} K(\\mathbf{x}_{i},\\mathbf{x}_{j}) = (\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\\mathbf{T}} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_{j} + 1)^{d}. \\tag{6.11}$$ These functions are applicable as SVM kernel functions because they can be cast in terms of dot products in Eq. \\eqref{eq_kerneltr} {% cite Scholkopf2000 -f {{ bib }} %}. Gaussian RBF has a parameter, gamma $$\\gamma$$, and Polynomial has a parameter, degree $$d$$. These parameters are called kernel parameters, and their optimal values are usually unknown. A common practice to find optimal values for the kernel parameters is to use k-fold cross validation. Figure [6.3](#F:6.3) shows four examples of both Gaussian RBF and Polynomial in two-dimensional space. The gamma parameter in Gaussian RBF represents an RBF width, which is sometimes referred to as $$1/2\\sigma^{2}$$, and a larger value means a smaller radius. For example, Figure [6.3](#F:6.3)A has gamma 0.5, and it is less specific and has a larger radius than Figure [6.3](#F:6.3)B with gamma 4.0. The degree parameter $$d$$ in Polynomial is a degree in a polynomial function, as in $$f(x) = a_{d}x^{d} + a_{d-1}x^{d-1} + \\cdots + a_{2}x^{2} + a_{1}x + a_{0}$$. Figure [6.3](#F:6.3)C and D show Polynomial kernels with degree 2 and 3, respectively. ### &nbsp; {#F:6.3} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 6.3]({{ fig6_3 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig6_3[1] }}\"} #### **Figure 6.3**. Non-linear kernels. {: .no_toc .text-caption } The figure shows four examples of two different non-linear kernel functions in two-dimensional space. Each kernel has two plots with different parameter values. Red circle and blue square dots represent data points with negative and positive labels, respectively. Three lines represent hyperplanes with the optimal hyperplane in the middle. The gray scale in the background indicates discriminant values. The darker indicates the smaller in negative values, whereas the lighter indicates the greater in positive values. The cost factor $$C$$ is 10 for all four kernels. **(A)** Gaussian RBF with $$\\gamma = 0.5$$. **(B)** Gaussian RBF with $$\\gamma = 4.0$$. **(C)** Polynomial with $$d = 2$$. **(D)** Polynomial with $$d = 3$$. {: .fs-2 } --- ## 6.5 Classifier evaluation: Confusion matrix and Receiver operating characteristics {#S:6.5} A binary classification is a type of classifications that predicts two class labels. To evaluate the performance of a binary classification model, one approach is to use the performance measures derived from the 2 × 2 confusion matrix that shows four possible outcomes with actual and predicted values (Table [6.1](#T:6.1)){% cite Provost1998 -f {{ bib }} %}. Another approach is to use Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) {% cite Swets1988 -f {{ bib }} %}. The confusion matrix requires only outcome labels as True or False, whereas ROC requires both outcome labels and discriminant values. ### **Table 6.1**. Confusion matrix. {#T:6.1} {: .no_toc .text-caption } The table shows four possible outcomes of binary classification. {: .fs-2 } | | Actual value | |+-----------------------+|+-------------+|+-------------------+|+--------------------+| | **Positive (P)** | **Negative (N)** | **Prediction outcome** | **Positive** | True Positive (TP) | False Positive (FP) | | **Negative** | False Negative (FN) | True Negative (TN) | --- Standard performance measures that are derived from the confusion matrix are Accuracy (ACC), Error rate (ERR), Sensitivity (SN), Specificity (SP), Positive predictive value (PPV), and Negative predictive value (NPV), and their equations are summarized in Table [6.2](#T:6.2). SN, SP, and PPV are also equivalent to True positive rate (TPR), True negative rate (TNR), and Precision (PRC), respectively. ### **Table 6.2**. Performance measures from confusion matrix. {#T:6.2} {: .no_toc .text-caption } The table shows the term and equation of six performance measures from the confusion matrix. {: .fs-2 } | Performance measure | Equation |----------------------------------|---------------------| Accuracy (ACC) | (TP + TN) / (P + N) | Error rate (ERR) | (FP + FN) / (P + N) | Sensitivity (SN) | TP / P | Specificity (SP) | TN / N | Positive predictive value (PPV) | TP / (TP + FP) | Negative predictive value (NPV) | TN / (TN + FN) | --- A ROC graph is a plot that shows False Positive Rate (FPR) or 1 - SP on the x axis and TPR on the y axis (Fig. [6.4](#F:6.4)). Many classifiers produce scores or discriminant values that can be used to adjust TPR and FPR. A ROC graph uses these adjusted TPR and FRP to draw curves by changing the threshold values of the scores. A single ROC point is drawn if a classifier has no such adjustment mechanism. A ROC graph contains all information in the confusion metrics, since FN is the complement of TP, and TN is the complement of FP {% cite Swets1988 -f {{ bib }} %}. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a performance measure to evaluate the ROC curves. The AUC indicates a perfect prediction and a random prediction when it is 1.0 and 0.5, respectively (Fig. [6.4](#F:6.4)A). In many cases, the ROC with AUC is a more adequate method to evaluate the classifier performance than single-number measures, such as Accuracy (ACC) {% cite Huang2005 Provost1997 -f {{ bib }} %}. It is also important to evaluate the trend of ROC curves. For instance, Figure [6.4](#F:6.4)B shows two classifiers, Classifier1 and Classifier2, that yield the same AUC scores. Classifier1 is a better classifier despite the same AUC values, because it has a better early retrieval performance, which means it has higher TPR when its SP is also high. The area marked orange in Figure [6.4](#F:6.4)B is the important region to estimate the early retrieval performance. Two variants of ROC, ROC50 {% cite Gribskov1996 -f {{ bib }} %} and concentrated ROC (CROC) {% cite Swamidass2010 -f {{ bib }} %} are especially useful when measuring the early retrieval performance. They are similar to evaluating the ROC curves in the high SP area as in Figure [6.4](#F:6.4)B, however, the AUC values of ROC50 and CROC can directly indicate the early retrieval performance. ### &nbsp; {#F:6.4} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 6.4]({{ fig6_4 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig6_4[1] }}\"} #### **Figure 6.4**. ROC curves and AUC scores. {: .no_toc .text-caption } The figures show six ROC curves with corresponding AUC scores and an example ROC plot with two classifiers. **(A)** The best AUC score is 1, and the worst score is 0. The random guess would yield the AUC score 0.5, and the predictions are opposite to expected when the AUC score is between 0 and 0.5. Six ROC curves have different AUC scores between 0.5 and 1.0 to show different prediction performances. **(B)** Two classifiers, Classifier1 and Classifier2 have the same AUC scores. The orange area in the left part of the plot indicates the critical area on evaluating ROC curves in terms of the early retrieval performance. {: .fs-2 } --- ## 6.6 Training and Test data: Single dataset hold-out and k-fold cross validation {#S:6.6} Supervised learning requires a test dataset for performance evaluation. A common problem in machine learning is overfitting, where the model overfits the training data, and it is generalized poorly to unseen data. Therefore, elaborated test procedures are important to maximize the performance and avoid overfitting simultaneously. Two major approaches to separate the test data set from the training data set are single dataset hold-out and k-fold cross validation. The single dataset hold-out testing is the simplest and most intuitive way to make a test dataset. The sample $$S_{n}$$ is divided randomly into two parts, $$S_{l}$$ for training and $$S_{k}$$ for testing, where the sample size $$n$$ is equal to $$l+k$$ {% cite Joachims2002 -f {{ bib }} %}. $$S_{k}$$ is treated as an independent testset, and it should never be used for training. Selecting values of $$l$$ and $$k$$ is a trade off, because larger $$l$$ results in smaller bias of the classifier, and smaller $$k$$ increases the variance for the evaluation {% cite Joachims2002 -f {{ bib }} %}. Cross validation is the most popular method because the whole dataset is trained and tested. There are several versions of the cross validation approach. Leave-one-out is a good performance estimator in many cases, but it demands very high computational power and it is also sensitive to the data structure. With leave one-out, one data point is removed from the training dataset for testing, and the test procedure continues until each data point is tested. To reduce the computational time, k-fold cross validation is commonly used instead of the leave-one-out approach. In k-fold cross validation, the training set is partitioned into k folds. One fold from the k folds is used as the test dataset, where the remaining dataset with k-1 folds is used for training {% cite Joachims2002 -f {{ bib }} %}. 10-fold cross validation with $$k=10$$ is widely used for the performance evaluations of classifiers. Analyzing unbalanced datasets is very common in bioinformatics. For example, some datasets are dominated by negative records with very few positive records, therefore the positive:negative ratio is unbalanced. Unbalanced datasets can present a challenge for any machine learning algorithm to achieve good performance {% cite Provost2000 Wu2003 -f {{ bib }} %}. SVM can deal with unbalanced data by assigning different soft-margin constants to each class label {% cite Ben-Hur2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. However, it is important to consider this imbalance when making training and test datasets. One approach to solve this imbalance is to use stratification. For example, a stratified k-fold cross validation selects k-fold datasets by sampling data from each subpopulation (stratum), which is a subset of the data with the same class label, independently. ## 6.7 SVM: Data pre-processing {#S:6.7} It is important to process data before training and testing. Two common approaches that may improve the SVM performance are categorical data conversion and scaling. SVM requires numerical feature vectors, therefore, categorical data need to be transformed. SVM usually achieves better performance when using $$m$$ feature vector components to represent an $$m$$-category feature instead of a single component {% cite Hsu2003 -f {{ bib }} %}. For example, a feature for a single RNA nucleotide {A,C,G,U} can be represented as (0,0,0,1), (0,0,1,0), (0,1,0,0) and (1,0,0,0). Scaling is very important for various machine learning algorithms including SVM {% cite Chang2001 -f {{ bib }} %}. Two common ways of scaling are linear scaling {% cite Hsu2003 -f {{ bib }} %} and standardizing {% cite Ben-Hur2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. With the linear scaling, all vector components are linearly transferred into the same range, for example, \\[-1, +1\\] or \\[0, 1\\], whereas with the standardizing, they are normalized by their mean and standard deviation. ## 6.8 SVM: Model selection {#S:6.8} The optimization of a classifier is an important phase to maximize the classifier performance. A common practice of model selection with SVM is to evaluate the classifier performance with different kernels and their corresponding parameters. The linear kernel has only one parameter, the soft-margin $$C$$, but non-linear kernels tend to have more parameters. The standard method of parameter optimization with two parameters is via grid-search {% cite Ben-Hur2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. For example, the Gaussian kernel has two parameters $$(C, \\gamma)$$, and the grid-search is performed by gradually changing the values of both parameters. ## 6.9 SVM: Multiclass and Regression {#S:6.9} In some cases, classifications involve more than two classes. Although some machine learning algorithms are strictly limited to binary classification, there are several SVM approaches that can handle multi-class problems {% cite Crammer2001 -f {{ bib }} %}. One example of such SVM multi-class approaches is a one-against-the-rest strategy {% cite Joachims2002 -f {{ bib }} %}. This strategy decomposes a multi-class problem into multiple independent binary classifications {% cite Crammer2001 -f {{ bib }} %}. A version of SVM for regression is called Support Vector Regression (SVR) {% cite Smola2003 -f {{ bib }} %}. The major difference between SVM and SVR is that the labels are real numbers for SVR rather than categorical data. The optimization problem of SVR is very similar to that of SVM with the prime form as: $$\\label{eq_svr_prime} \\begin{array}{l l} \\underset{\\mathbf{w},b}{\\text{minimize}} & \\dfrac{1}{2}||\\mathbf{w}||^{2} \\\\ \\text{subject to}: & \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l} \\mathbf{w^{T}x}_{i} + b - y_{i} \\leq \\varepsilon \\\\ y_{i} - \\mathbf{w^{T}x}_{i} - b \\leq \\varepsilon \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. ,\\\\ \\end{array} \\tag{6.12}$$ where $$\\varepsilon$$ is used to control the errors. SVR can also be transformed to the dual form and handle soft-margin and kernel functions {% cite Smola2003 -f {{ bib }} %}. ## 6.10 Other supervised learning algorithms: Decision tree, Artificial neural network, Naive Bayesian, and $$k$$-nearest neighbor {#S:6.10} Some popular and widely used supervised learning algorithms are Decision tree {% cite Murthy1997 -f {{ bib }} %}, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) {% cite Rumelhart1986 -f {{ bib }} %}, Naive Bayes (NB) {% cite Cestnik1987 -f {{ bib }} %}, and $$k$$-nearest neighbor ($$k$$-NN) {% cite Cover1967 -f {{ bib }} %}. These four algorithms are often used for comparisons with SVM, and they are also introduced as supervised learning algorithms together with SVM {% cite Caruana2006 Kotsiantis2007 Joachims2002 Yan2007 Tarca2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. Decision tree learning uses a tree-like hierarchical graph with multiple nodes. Three different types of nodes are the root as the first node, internal nodes, and the leaves as terminal nodes. A predicted class label can be obtained when the decision making process reaches a leaf, because each leaf contains a probability distribution over the class labels as the results of training {% cite Kingsford2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Some learning algorithms, such as Random Forests {% cite Statistics2001 -f {{ bib }} %}, can combine multiple decision trees. The Random Forests algorithm makes many different decision trees randomly, and it predicts the class labels by combing the outputs of these decision trees {% cite Kingsford2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. ANN is a machine learning method that is inspired by the structure and functionalities of biological neural networks in the brain {% cite Kotsiantis2007 Krogh2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. The central nervous system (CNS) in the brain has interconnected networks of neurons that communicate among each other by sending electric pulses through axons, synapses and dendrites. ANN consists of nodes, or \"neurons\", that are connected together to form a network that mimics the network in the CNS. The single layered perceptron, which is the simplest form of ANN, is a simple feedforward network {% cite Rosenblatt1957 -f {{ bib }} %}. The single layered perceptron can only solve linearly separable problems {% cite Krogh2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. The multi-layered perceptron has been developed to solve non-linear problems {% cite Rumelhart1986 -f {{ bib }} %}, and it has an input layer, an output layer, and one or more hidden layers in-between. The multi-layered perceptron with the error back-propagation method {% cite Rumelhart1986a -f {{ bib }} %}, which is an algorithm that aims at optimizing the weight values by minimizing the errors from the output layer to the hidden layers, enables fairly complex neural networks to solve non-linear problem {% cite Rumelhart1986 -f {{ bib }} %}. The NB classifier is a type of statistical learning algorithm. To obtain the probability model of a class variable $$C$$, NB uses Bayes' theorem: $$\\label{eq_bayes} p(C|X_{1},...,X{n}) = \\dfrac{p(C)p(X_{1},...,X{n}|C)}{p(X_{1},...,X{n})}, \\tag{6.13}$$ and it assumes that all feature variables, $$X_{1},...,X{n}$$ are independent. The numerator of Eq. \\eqref{eq_bayes} is equivalent to the joint probability model, $$p(C,X_{1},...,X{n})$$, which can be expressed as $$p(C)\\prod_{i=1}^{n}p(X_{i}|C)$$ by the definition of conditionally probability when $$X_{1},...,X{n}$$ are independent. Since the denominator of Eq. \\eqref{eq_bayes} can be considered as constant, the probability model for a classifier is $$p(C|X_{1},...,X{n}) \\propto p(C)\\prod_{i=1}^{n}p(X_{i}|C)$$. It is easy to calculate the probabilities for the classes from training with this model especially when it is log transformed. The assumption of independence of feature variables is almost always wrong, therefore NB classifiers are usually considered as less accurate {% cite Kotsiantis2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. Nonetheless, despite its naive and over simplified assumptions, NB classifiers outperform other sophisticated learning algorithms in some cases {% cite Domingos1997 Caruana2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. $$k$$-NN is an instance-based learning algorithm, which delays the induction or generalization process until the classification phase {% cite Kotsiantis2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. When a data point needs to be classified, the distances of the data point from all the training data points are calculated. Subsequently, all the training points are sorted by the calculated distance, and the label that is the most frequent in top $$k$$ points is selected as output {% cite Tarca2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. $$k$$-NN is very simple, and it can use any type of distance metrics, such as Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowsky {% cite Kotsiantis2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. However, it is computationally inefficient in some cases especially when the data size is large because $$k$$-NN requires to calculate the lengths at each time of classification. Both SVM and ANN tend to perform better on data with multi-dimensions and continuous features, but they require large sample size to achieve high accuracy. NB works well with relatively small sample size, but it requires strong (naive) independence assumptions. Decision tree learning performs well with classifying categorical data {% cite Kotsiantis2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. It is usually based on a heuristic algorithm, and it fails to find optimal solutions in some cases. $$k$$-NN is very simple to understand and interpret, but it is sensitive to irrelevant features {% cite Kotsiantis2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. ## References {#S:6.11} {% bibliography --cited_in_order -f {{ bib }} %} ",

TOC {:toc} --- This chapter gives an overview of the computational implementation approaches used in our research. We mainly used Python for general programming, and R for statistical programming and analysis. This chapter also briefly gives additional information about software development methodologies and data storage. ## 7.1 Software development methodologies: Rapid application development and Test-driven development {#S:7.1} Many conventional software development methodologies, such as variants of the waterfall method {% cite Royce1970 -f {{ bib }} %}, require strict documentation at the design phase, and full implementation rather than prototyping in the implementation phase. A waterfall method is a sequential design process flowing steadily downwards through the phases of the software development life cycle. These strict and non-flexible software development phases of conventional methodologies led to many failed system development projects in the 1980s and early 1990s, especially in large-scale projects. Rapid application development (RAD) {% cite Martin1991 -f {{ bib }} %} is a relatively new software development methodology, which aims to decrease the complexity of implementation and increase the speed of application development. There are many types of RADs, such as Scrum {% cite Rising2000 -f {{ bib }} %}, Agile software development (Agile) {% cite Cockburn2001 -f {{ bib }} %}, and Extreme Programming (XP) {% cite Auer2001 -f {{ bib }} %}. Most of them focus on simplifying each phase and reducing the duration of the software development cycle. One of the most suitable RADs for small or mid-size bioinformatics projects is Test-driven development (TDD) {% cite Beck2002 -f {{ bib }} %}, which is equivalent to the test-first programming concepts of XP. TDD enforces the creation of unit tests before actual coding. Although full compliance to TDD is not necessary, making as many unit tests as possible with mock data can ensure high reliability of the application. ## 7.2 Programming languages: Object-oriented programming and Python {#S:7.2} The most popular programming paradigm today is object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP uses \"objects\" defined by corresponding \"classes\". Objects are actual data with data structure and procedures, whereas classes are definitions or templates to make objects. Many programming languages currently support full or partial OOP, and some of the popular ones are C++, Java, Perl, and Python. All of these programming languages are freely available (Table [7.1](#T:7.1)), and they are widely used in bioinformatics analysis. Table [7.1](#T:7.1) also shows two additional languages Haskell and Go, as examples of functional programming and concurrent programming paradigms, though these paradigms are less common than OOP in general. ### **Table 7.1**. Programming languages. {#T:7.1} {: .no_toc .text-caption } The table shows a list of freely available programming languages. \"program\", \"type\", and \"URL for software environment\" represent the name of programming language, the name of programming paradigm, and the URL for downloading software environment, respectively. OOP, Func, Conc in the \"type\" column represents three different programming paradigms: object-oriented, functional, and concurrent programming, respectively. {: .fs-2 } | Program | Type | URL for software environment |---------------|------|-------------------------------------------| C++ (GNU) | OOP | | Java (Oracle) | OOP | | Perl | OOP | | Python | OOP | | Haskell | Func | | Go | Conc | --- Among them, Python has emerged as one of the most popular languages in bioinformatics. Python requires no static type checking, which enhances the productivity with the RAD approach. It also offers multiple programming paradigms, therefore, it can use both object-oriented and functional programming in the same module, for instance. Moreover, Python offers two very powerful libraries for scientific computing: NumPy () and SciPy (). BioPython () provides a set of libraries for biological computation to Python. A machine learning package for Python called PyML provides useful functions to build and test a SVM model {% cite Ben-Hur2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. We mainly used PyML to build our two-step SVM model for miRNA target prediction. ## 7.3 Statistical programming languages: R and other statistical computing languages {#S:7.3} Some programming languages are specialized for statistical computing and graphics. For instance, SAS, SPSS, STATA, and R support software environments for statistical computing, whereas MATLAB and Mathematica are languages that provide statistical features. Among them, only R is open source software and freely available (Table [7.2](#T:7.2)). Moreover, R provides many additional libraries and also a comprehensive framework for high-throughput genome data analysis, called Bioconductor (), hence, it is the most popular statistical computing language for bioinformatics today. ### **Table 7.2**. Programming languages for statistical analysis. {#T:7.2} {: .no_toc .text-caption } The table shows a list of programming languages that can be used for statistical analysis. \"program\", license\", and \"URL\" represent the name of programming language, the type of license, and the URL for organizations or institutes that provide the software, respectively. {: .fs-2 } | Program | License | URL |-------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------| SAS | proprietary | | SPSS | proprietary | | STATA | proprietary | | R | open source | | MATLAB | proprietary | | Mathematica | proprietary | --- ## 7.4 Data storage: Text files and MySQL {#S:7.4} Handling the large size data from experiments with high-throughput technologies usually requires a method for effective data retrieval and manipulation. The easiest approach is using a text file with user-defined or pre-defined format. Some examples of popular pre-defined formats in bioinformatics are FASTA for nucleotide and peptide sequences, GFF (general feature format) for positional information with additional features in genome, and MAF (multiple alignment format) for multiple alignments. A relational database (RDB) {% cite Codd1970 -f {{ bib }} %} management system offers more elaborate data storage mechanisms than simple text files. In RDB, data are usually accessed through the structured query language (SQL), and all data are stored in multiple tables. MySQL is the most popular freely available RDB used by bioinformatics projects, but other free RDBs, such as PostgreSQL or Postgres, and SQLite, are also widely used (Table [7.3](#T:7.3)). ### **Table 7.3**. Relational databases. {#T:7.3} {: .no_toc .text-caption } The table shows a list of relational and NoSQL databases. 1PostgreSQL Global Development Group. 2SQLite Consortium. 3Google App Engine provides BigTable accessibility. {: .fs-2 } | Name | Type | Provider | URL |------------|-------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------| MySQL | RDB | Oracle | | PostgreSQL | RDB | PGDG1 | | SQLite | RDB | SQLite Cons2 | | MongoDB | NoSQL | 10gen | | BigTable | NoSQL | Google | 3 | SimpleDB | NoSQL | Amazon | --- In RDB, the data in multiple tables are \"joined\" when retrieving them together. All RDB management systems have very poor performance with joining tables at tera- or peta- byte level. Therefore, NoSQL database management systems have emerged to control data even at peta byte level. NoSQL usually avoids SQL usage and relational tables. Many NoSQL systems are available today, and some popular NoSQLs are MongoDB, Google BigTable {% cite Chang2006 -f {{ bib }} %}, and Amazon SimpleDB (Table [7.3](#T:7.3)). Even though handling data at tera byte level is important as more sequence data from the next generation sequencing become available, many programming languages currently lack easy-to-use libraries to access NoSQL management systems. Therefore, using both text files and RDBs rather than NoSQL is still a major practice in bioinformatics. ## References {#S:7.5} {% bibliography --cited_in_order -f {{ bib }} %} ",

Many further perspectives are covered in the papers, therefore, this section covers only additional perspectives that are not discussed in the papers. Firstly, for *[miRNA target prediction]({{ path_prediction }}/)*, it is important to improve the computational speed of our two-step SVM model at the classification phase. A current computational limitation of our model at classification is mainly caused due to its usage of non-linear kernel at the second or global level. Therefore, optimizing the second level classifier with a linear kernel is a simple solution to improve the computational speed at the classification phase. Moreover, training a SVM model with AGO pull-down data is simple, but it can be a very effective approach. However, existing AGO pull-down experiments provide no information regarding difference of miRNA binding sites between controls and transfected samples, therefore some scores, such as log-ratio values in microarray, need to be calculated for SVM training. Secondly, the results from our study in *[miRNA high-throughput experiments]({{ path_experiment }}/)* can potentially improve other studies in both *[miRNA target prediction]({{ path_prediction }}/)* and *[miRNA and other ncRNAs]({{ path_ncrna }}/)* because they mainly rely on the data from microarray, proteomics, and next generation sequencing for their model building and statistical analysis. Further interesting work can be an expansion of the analysis with different types of data, such as expression profiles of NCI-60 microarray data sets or time points data. Thirdly, understanding of ncRNAs characteristics and their interactions with miRNAs becomes more important because ncRNA:ncRNA interactions are likely involved in many gene regulations. In addition to cis-NATs and CARs, it is interesting to expand the same approach to other types of ncRNAs, such as long ncRNAs. In conclusion, using data from next generation sequencing as well as considering the results from *[miRNA high-throughput experiments]({{ path_experiment }}/)* is most likely to enhance other studies in both *[miRNA target prediction]({{ path_prediction }}/)* and *[miRNA and other ncRNAs]({{ path_ncrna }}/)*.

TOC {:toc} ## Abstract {#S:1} ### Background {: .no_toc } MicroRNA (miRNA) target genes tend to have relatively long and conserved 3' UTRs, but to what degree these characteristics contribute to miRNA targeting is poorly understood. Different high-throughput experiments have for example shown that miRNAs preferentially regulate genes with both short and long 3' UTRs and that target site conservation is both important and irrelevant for miRNA targeting. ### Results {: .no_toc } We have analyzed several gene context-dependent features, including 3' UTR length, 3' UTR conservation, and mRNA expression levels, reported to have conflicting influence on miRNA regulation. By taking into account confounding factors such as technology-dependent experimental bias and competition between transfected and endogenous miRNAs, we show that two factors – target gene expression and competition – could explain most of the previously reported experimental differences. Moreover, we find that these and other target site-independent features explain about the same amount of variation in target gene expression as the target site-dependent features included in the TargetScan model. ### Conclusions {: .no_toc } Our results show that it is important to consider confounding factors when interpreting miRNA high throughput experiments and urge especial caution when using microarray data to compare average regulatory effects between groups of genes that have different average gene expression levels. ## Keywords {: .no_toc } microRNA targets, siRNA, microarray, proteomics, PAR-CLIP ## Background {#S:2} MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that negatively regulate protein-coding genes {% cite Ambros2004 Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. MicroRNAs are involved in many important regulatory roles {% cite Hwang2007 Stefani2008 Croce2009 -f {{ bib }} %}, and current estimates indicate that miRNAs regulate at least 60% of the human protein-coding genes {% cite Friedman2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. In animals, functional miRNA sites preferentially reside in 3' UTRs {% cite Bartel2009 -f {{ bib }} %}, and these sites are generally well conserved {% cite Friedman2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Moreover, some ubiquitously expressed genes, such as housekeeping genes, have shorter 3' UTRs to potentially avoid miRNA regulation {% cite Bartel2004 Stark2005 -f {{ bib }} %}, whereas proliferating cells express mRNAs with shortened 3' UTRs to avoid miRNA regulation {% cite Sandberg2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Hence, miRNA target genes are likely to have relatively long and conserved 3' UTRs. However, what degree the length and conservation of 3' UTR contribute to miRNA targeting is still poorly understood. To illustrate, data from Argonaute immunoprecipitation (RIP) in human and fly indicate that miRNAs target short 3' UTRs {% cite Hausser2009 Hong2009 -f {{ bib }} %}, whereas microarray data from miRNA transfection experiments and sequence data from Argonaute cross-linked immunoprecipitation (CLIP) experiments indicate that miRNAs target long 3' UTRs {% cite Wen2011 -f {{ bib }} %}. Wen and colleagues also found that target site conservation was more important for CLIP-supported target sites than for targets that were down-regulated in the transfection experiments {% cite Wen2011 -f {{ bib }} %}. Moreover, our previous study {% cite Saito2010 -f {{ bib }} %} showed that genes with a 3' UTR longer than 4000 nucleotides were less affected by ectopically expressed miRNAs than were genes with a shorter 3' UTR, and that target site conservation had little or no effect on our miRNA target prediction algorithm’s performance. In addition to 3' UTR length and conservation, several other gene characteristics also affect miRNA regulation. For example, many miRNAs are known to regulate genes involved in cell development processes {% cite Stefani2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Another example is that miRNAs appear to preferentially target genes with high CpG promoters {% cite Sinha2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Also, as highly expressed genes transcribe a large number of mRNAs, the miRNA regulation of those mRNAs can be different from those of weakly expressed genes, although current analyses disagree on whether miRNAs affect highly expressed genes more or less than medium or lowly expressed genes {% cite Hafner2010 Larsson2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. High throughput experiments based on microarrays or proteomics have been important for characterizing miRNA regulation {% cite Lim2005 Grimson2007 Baek2008 Selbach2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Although these and more recent comparative studies {% cite Hausser2009 Wen2011 -f {{ bib }} %} found that some features such as seed complementarity and seed strength are consistently important for miRNA targeting, other features such as 3' UTR length and site conservation mentioned above differ between studies and technologies. There are at least three potential features that may contribute to the difference between miRNA high-throughput experiments. First, the number of genes that cover a microarray experiment is usually much larger than that of a proteomics experiment. For instance, Baek et al. {% cite Baek2008 -f {{ bib }} %} used both microarray and proteomics for their miRNA target gene analysis, and the number of genes detected for microarray and proteomics samples were about 20000 and 2000, respectively. Second, transfected (exogenous) miRNAs compete with endogenous miRNAs for the protein complex needed for miRNA regulation {% cite Khan2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Therefore, genes targeted by endogenous miRNAs but not by the exogenous miRNA can be up-regulated. Third, the effect of miRNA regulation can be diluted by target abundance, which means that each target gene is less down-regulated when the miRNA has many highly expressed compared with few lowly expressed target genes {% cite Arvey2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. Common for these features is that they are target site-independent, but gene context-dependent. In this study, we have investigated the effects on miRNA targeting of several such target site-independent but gene context-dependent features. We categorized these features into three types: (i) target mRNA features, as 3' UTR length, 3' UTR sequence conservation, and mRNA expression level; (ii) sample features, as the competition and dilution effects; and (iii) platform features, as different types of technologies and experimental methods. We found that two features – the competition effect between endogenous miRNAs and transfected miRNAs, and mRNA expression level – have a strong impact on results from high throughput experiments. Both features are confounding factors that explain many of the previously reported differences between different studies and high throughput technologies. Considering these confounding factors is important to analyze accurately and robustly different types of miRNA high-throughput experiments and to infer correctly the characteristics of miRNA regulation. ## Results and discussion {#S:3} ### Target mRNA features: Ectopic miRNA expression differentially affects subgroups of genes with differing 3' UTR length, 3' UTR conservation, and mRNA expression level. {#S:3-1} As we expected that mRNAs targeted by miRNA have long and conserved 3' UTRs, we wanted to examine how these characteristics actually affect miRNA regulation. Specifically, we wondered whether there was a difference in how different gene groups, such as genes with long, medium, or short 3' UTRs or genes with high, medium, or low 3' UTR conservation, were affected by ectopic miRNA expression. To address this question, we used microarray and proteomics data from five and two miRNA transfection experiments, respectively, and microarray data from two miRNA inhibition experiments and analyzed the differences in gene expression log ratio values of predicted targets in the different gene groups (see [Methods](#S:5-1)). We also included microarray data from a siRNA transfection experiment, as siRNAs behave as miRNAs in terms of target recognition {% cite Birmingham2006 Jackson2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. In contrast to evolutionary selected miRNA targets, however, targets for artificially designed exogenous siRNAs should be evolutionary unbiased. The siRNA dataset therefore served as an estimate of the general regulatory effects of over-expressing small RNAs. In total, we used 10 different types of miRNA high-throughput experiments, which covered 140 samples and 70 miRNAs and siRNAs (Table [S1]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S1) and [S2]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S2)) in the Supplementary information). We first, for each miRNA and siRNA, separated predicted miRNA or siRNA target genes from the rest. The predicted target genes were genes that have at least one canonical seed site in their 3' UTRs (see [Methods](#S:5-2)). We used the set of predicted miRNA or siRNA target genes to analyze miRNA down-regulation effects on three different target mRNA features: (i) 3' UTR length, (ii) 3' UTR conservation, and (iii) mRNA expression level as determined by RNA-Seq counts. We split these three features into smaller sub-groups as described in the [Methods](#S:5-2) section. We then used a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test to determine whether the predicted target genes in one sub-group were significantly more down-regulated than the genes in the rest of the sub-groups (Fig. [1](#F:1)). To illustrate, Fig. [1](#F:1)A and [1](#F:2)B show the cumulative density plots of the log-ratio values for the 3' UTR length sub-groups on the Lim microarray and Selbach proteomics datasets. In the Lim dataset (Fig. [1](#F:1)A), the sub-group Med Short, representing genes with 3' UTRs in the range of 248-629 nts, was significantly left-shifted and therefore more down-regulated than the rest as indicated in the corresponding heatmap (Fig. [1](#F:1)C; p-value 4.02e-17; Table [S3]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S3) in the Supplementary information). In the Selbach proteomics dataset (Fig. [1](#F:1)B), the Short sub-group was most shifted to the left compared to the others, but the differences were not as significant as in the Lim dataset – likely due to the smaller dataset (Fig. [1](#F:1)C; p-value 0.02; Table [S3]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S3) in the Supplementary information). Tables [S3]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S3)-[S5]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S5) in the Supplementary Information summarize all p-values of one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test on 3' UTR length, 3' UTR conservation, and mRNA expression; Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests on the same sub-groups gave similar results (Tables [S6]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S6)-[S8]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S8) in the Supplementary Information). The following sections describe and discuss the results for each target mRNA feature. #### &nbsp; {#F:1} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 1]({{ fig1 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig1[1] }}\"} ##### **Figure 1**.

Although the mRNA expression data **(E)** was cell type specific and for HeLa cells, we included the Linsley dataset (from HCT116 and DLD-1 colon tumor cells) in the heat map for comparison purpose (indicated with “*”). The color labels under the dendrogram represent green for microarray of transfection assay, gray for proteomics of transfection assay, and orange for both microarray and proteomics with inhibition assay. {: .fs-2 } --- ### Target mRNA features: Predicted target genes with short 3' UTRs are more down-regulated than genes with long 3' UTRs. {#S:3-2} We have previously reported that genes with very long 3' UTRs (>4000 nts) are poor targets for ectopically expressed miRNAs or siRNAs {% cite Saito2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. Consistent with this, there was no experiment that showed significant down-regulation for the Very Long sub-group (Fig. [1](#F:1)C , Table [S3]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S3) in the Supplementary information). Interestingly, genes with short or medium 3' UTRs (Short, Med Short, and Med Long) were significantly down-regulated compared to genes with long 3' UTRs (Long and Very Long) among nearly all of the experiments. We saw the strongest effect for 3' UTRs with sub-groups Med Short and Med Long, as one or both groups were significantly down-regulated compared to other predicted targets in 8 of 10 experiments (Table [S3]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S3) in the Supplementary Information). Between these two sub-groups, Med Short had lower p-values than Med Long in 7 of 10 experiments. Using the one-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test as an alternative test method also supported the same trends (Table [S6]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S6) in the Supplementary Information). These results indicate that miRNA or siRNA target genes with short 3' UTRs were generally more down-regulated than genes with long 3' UTRs. ### Target mRNA features: Conservation in 3' UTR regions has inconsistent regulatory effects. {#S:3-3} Although the sub-group of highly conserved 3' UTR regions was strongly down-regulated in 5 of 10 experiments, the non-conserved sub-group was down-regulated in 2 of 10 experiments (Fig. [1](#F:1)D, Table [S4]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S4) in the Supplementary Information). One possible explanation for this inconsistent pattern could be the conservation levels of the miRNAs used in the experiments. Since highly conserved miRNAs tend to have more target genes than less-conserved miRNA, highly conserved miRNAs may be more affected by the reported target dilution effect {% cite Arvey2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. However, we found no significant correlations between the degree of miRNA conservation and the down-regulation effects (data not shown). Moreover, the siRNAs used in the Jackson experiment should be unaffected by 3' UTR conservation, but these siRNAs strongly down-regulated highly conserved 3' UTRs compared with other 3' UTRs. We observed the same inconsistency for 3' UTR conservation when testing with the one-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (Table [S7]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S7) in the Supplementary Information). Thus, although highly conserved 3' UTRs in some cases can be better targets for ectopically expressed small RNAs, the inconsistent regulatory effects suggest that other factors are more important. ### Target mRNA features: Predicted target genes with high mRNA expression levels are more down-regulated than the genes with low mRNA expression levels. {#S:3-4} A recent study showed that mRNA expression affects siRNA efficacy such that lowly expressed mRNAs are less affected by siRNAs than are highly expressed mRNAs {% cite Larsson2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. Consistent with these results, siRNA and miRNA target genes with high or medium expression as measured by RNA-seq {% cite Birney2007 -f {{ bib }} %} were significantly down-regulated compared to the rest of the sub-groups in the microarray experiments (Fig. [1](#F:1)E). We saw a very strong down-regulatory effect on mRNA expression with sub-groups Very High, High, and Medium, as one or more sub-groups were significantly down-regulated compared to other predicted targets in 7 of 10 experiments (Table [S5](({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S5)) in the Supplementary Information). Moreover, there was no experiment that showed significant p-values for sub-groups Very Low and NoExp. One-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests also gave similar results (Table [S8]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S8) in the Supplementary Information). These results indicate that predicted miRNA or siRNA target genes with high or moderate expression levels are generally more down-regulated than genes with low expression levels. ### Target mRNA features: Comparison tests on individual samples strongly support that the differences between subgroups are common for many miRNAs. {#S:3-5} Our analyses so far showed clear differences in how ectopic miRNA and siRNA expression affected certain subgroups of genes. Since these differences were based on the average effects of multiple miRNAs, however, we could not exclude that these differences were due to a few miRNAs instead of being common effects for many miRNAs. To test this possibility, we repeated the tests of the three target mRNA features – 3' UTR length, 3' UTR conservation, and mRNA expression levels – individually on the 140 different samples (Table [S2]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S2) in the Supplementary Information). We then calculated the proportions of samples that showed significant p-values (Table [S9]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S9)-[S11]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S11) in the Supplementary Information) and defined these proportions as Sample level scores (see [Methods](#S:5-3)). Consequently, a subgroup with Sample level score = 0.5 would be significant in 70 (50%) of the individual experiments. To compare the trends of the test results between experiments and samples, we created two types of counts to represent the trends for both experiments and samples: (i) the number of experiments that had significant p-values from the test results of the experiments, and (ii) the number of experiments that had their Sample level scores greater than 0.5 (Table. [1](#T:1)). The trends of mRNA expression level for experiments and samples were very similar for (Pearson *r* = 0.91; p-value = 0.01), whereas the trends of other two features showed high but insignificant correlation coefficients (3' UTR length, *r* = 0.79, p-value = 0.11; 3' UTR conservation, *r* = 0.81, p-value = 0.19). The results show that many individual samples support the overall trends for each experiment set – especially for the mRNA expression level features. --- #### **Table 1**. Multiple compassion tests at an individual sample level support the experimental level test results. {#T:1} {: .no_toc .text-caption } {% include tbl_simple.html data=tab1 %} **Exp**: the number of experiments that have significant p-value. **Smp**: the number of experiments that have Sample level scores greater than 0.5. {: .fs-2 } --- ### Sample features: Competition with endogenous miRNAs impacts exogenous miRNAs’ targeting of genes with long 3' UTRs. {#S:3-6} Small RNA transfection perturbs endogenous miRNA regulation such that genes targeted by endogenous miRNAs can become up-regulated {% cite Khan2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. We therefore hypothesized that genes with long 3' UTRs had a net unaffected expression or reduced response because these genes potentially had more endogenous miRNA target sites than genes with short 3' UTRs. To test this hypothesis, we separated the genes into four groups based on whether the genes were predicted to be targeted by the exogenous miRNAs and by highly expressed endogenous miRNAs. Both the first (T +Endo) and the second (T -Endo) groups consist of genes targeted by exogenous miRNAs, whereas the third (NT +Endo) and the fourth (NT -Endo) groups consist of genes without exogenous miRNA targets. The second word in the group names indicates that the group contains either genes targeted by endogenous miRNAs (+Endo) or genes without endogenous miRNA targets (-Endo) (Table [S12]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S12) in the Supplementary Information; see [Methods](#S:5-2)). Specifically, we used two of the four groups, T -Endo and T +Endo, for statistical analysis. We only used 8 transfected experiments and excluded 2 inhibition experiments because Selbach locked nucleic acid (LNA) and Linsley 2'-O-methyl (OME) experiments inhibited endogenous miRNAs. Consistent with our hypothesis, there were no T - Endo genes that belonged to the Very Long sub-group in any of the eight experiments (Fig. [2](#F:2)A; Table [S13]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S13) in the Supplementary Information). For the other sub-groups of 3' UTR length, we tested whether T -Endo genes were more down-regulated than T +Endo genes (Table [S13]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S13) in the Supplementary Information). Although the majority of experiments showed no significant differences for the subgroups, T -Endo genes were significantly more down-regulated than T +Endo genes for sub-group Long in three of eight experiments. Moreover, the only other significant difference was for the Med Long sub-group on the Selbach dataset, where T -Endo genes again were significantly more down-regulated than T +Endo genes. These results suggest that genes with a very long 3' UTR are less affected by exogenous miRNAs than are other genes because these genes have a higher chance of being under the influence of endogenous miRNAs. #### &nbsp; {#F:2} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 2]({{ fig2 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig2[1] }}\"} ##### **Figure 2**.

We mapped PAR-CLIP-supported AGO binding sites in 3' UTR regions and for each of the five different sub-groups defined by 3' UTR length, we counted the number of genes with binding sites (Table. [2](#T:2)). We found more AGO binding sites in long 3' UTR genes (Very Long and Long) than in short 3' UTR genes (Med Long, Med Short, and Short) when compared with all available RefSeq genes (p-values 0.5), the tests on samples showed no strong support for the trend observed when tested on the experiments. With a less strict threshold of Sample level scores (>0), the tests on samples supported the trend for mRNA expression level (Pearson *r* = 0.86; p-value = 0.03), whereas the 3' UTR length showed some but insignificant support of the experiment-level results (*r* = 0.47; p-value = 0.42). The 3' UTR conservation showed no correlation with the experiment-level results (*r* = -0.10; p-value = 0.9). Together, the results indicated that some samples support the result from the collective experiments that the competition effect more strongly affects genes with high compared with low mRNA expression level. ### Platform features: Microarray datasets can have cryptic bias towards detecting differential expression in highly expressed genes. {#S:3-11} A recent study showed that mRNA expression affects siRNA efficacy such that lowly expressed mRNAs are less affected by siRNAs than are highly expressed mRNAs {% cite Larsson2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. Consistent with these results, siRNA and miRNA target genes with high or medium expression, as measured by RNA-seq {% cite Birney2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, were significantly down-regulated compared to the rest of the sub-groups in the microarray experiments (Fig. [1](#F:1)E). However, these trends were not apparent in the proteomics datasets, which instead showed significant effects on the lowly expressed genes (two of three experiments; Table [S5]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S5) in the Supplementary Information). The cumulative density plots of log-ratio values for the Grimson microarray and Selbach proteomics datasets illustrate the differences (Fig. [3](#F:3)A, B). The three sub-groups of very high, high, and medium expression were left-shifted and therefore more strongly down-regulated relative to the other groups in the Grimson microarray dataset (Fig. [3](#F:3)A). Indeed, the groups’ expression level appeared to strictly determine the degree of down-regulation, as the very highly expressed genes were more left-shifted compared to the highly expressed genes and so on. In contrast, the Selbach proteomics datasets showed no such trends (Fig. [3](#F:3)B); the three sub-groups with the highest expression levels were similarly affected, whereas the lowly expressed genes were slightly more down-regulated than the other groups. #### &nbsp; {#F:3} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 3]({{ fig3 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig3[1] }}\"} ##### **Figure 3**.

Consistent with published results that multiple miRNA target sites enhance miRNA down-regulation {% cite Guo2010 -f {{ bib }} %}, the number of target sites (#site_m) was the strongest factor, and consistent with our non-parametric tests, mRNA expression (exp) had the second largest coefficient. Furthermore, 3' UTR length (ln3), the number of target sites for endogenous miRNAs (#endo_m), and the total number of target sites per sample (#site_s) had strong negative coefficients, whereas transfection compared with inhibition experiments (e_oe) had, as expected, a positive coefficient. Partly contrary to the non-parametric analyses, however, 3' UTR conservation (cs3) was consistently and strongly associated with target knock-down, but this result likely reflects that highly conserved 3' UTRs were strongly associated with target knock-down in four of the ten experiments (Fig. [1](#F:1)). #### &nbsp; {#F:5} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 5]({{ fig5 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig5[1] }}\"} ##### **Figure 5**. Coefficients of a linear regression with eight factors. {: .no_toc .text-caption } The dot plot shows the coefficients of the liner model with formula: -log ratio = ln3 + cs3 + exp +#site_m + #endo_m + #site_s + p_ma + e_oe. The dot size shows -log10 of the coefficient’s p-value. Positive coefficients associate with miRNA down-regulation. {: .fs-2 } --- ### Regression analysis: Factor crossing in the linear model confirmed that several factors have combined effects on miRNA down-regulation. {#S:3-14} Based on our analyses of the individual target, sample, and experiment features, we expected that some factor pairs such as exp and p_ma, #site_m and #endo_m, and cs3 and e_oe had strong combined effects. To investigate this possibility, we extended our simple linear model to include all second-order interactions, such as ln3 * cs3, ln3 * exp, and so on. This extension slightly increased the R2 of the model (R2 = 0.047; adjusted R2 = 0.046). Although directly comparing coefficients was less straightforward than for the simpler model without factor interactions because of different range distributions for combined factors, there were still several factors that had significantly higher or lower coefficients than the others (Fig. [S4]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S4) and Table [S18]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S18) in the Supplementary information). The number of target sites for the ectopically expressed miRNA or siRNA (#site_m) had the highest coefficient, whereas the interaction between #site_m and the number of target sites for endogenous miRNAs (#endo_m) had the lowest and most significant coefficient. Consistent with the number of target sites’ importance for regulation, most factor combinations that included #site_m were significant. These results confirm that the number of target sites (#site_m) is the most important factor to explain log ratio changes, but that several other interacting factors and especially competition with endogenous miRNAs (#endo_m) influence the resulting target knock-down. Of the other factors, target expression (exp) was still among the most significant single factor. Moreover, consistent with our previous results, the coefficients for exp’s interaction with the two experiment factors (p_ma and e_oe) were strong, significant, and positive. In contrast, exp by itself or interacting with 3' UTR length (ln3) had a significant negative coefficient. Consequently, our results suggest that when experiment-related features are factored out, miRNAs do more strongly affect lowly than highly expressed genes. As for the remaining features, both ln3 and cs3 showed significant interactions with expected features. Especially cs3 showed strong and significant interactions with many factors (all except ln3, exp, and p_ma), which likely explains the conflicting results for 3' UTR conservation in the individual feature analyses. ### Regression analysis: target site-dependent features, as modeled by TargetScan scores show strong interactions with site-independent features. {#S:3-15} So far, our regression models and analyses considered all stringent seed sites as equally important target sites (see [Methods](#S:5-2)), but different features of individual target sites, such as the seed type, the site’s AU context, the site’s location in 3’ UTR, and additional pairing between the miRNA 3' end and mRNA, do affect miRNA targeting {% cite Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. We therefore extended our regression model to include TargetScan {% cite Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %} scores (see [Methods](#S:5-2)) to determine how the predicted effects of individual miRNA target sites affect and interact with the mRNA, sample, and platform level features in our model. A simple regression model with only TargetScan scores had R2 = 0.043, which was very similar to the previous models with eight factors (R2 = 0.040 and R2 = 0.046 for the simple and combined effects models, respectively). In contrast, a simple regression model that included all the nine factors showed increased R2 (R2 = 0.071; adjusted R2 = 0.071). The most significant single factor in this model was TargetScan score (ts_score; Fig. [6](#F:6); Table [S19]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S19) in the Supplementary information). Most factors showed very similar trends compared with the previous model with eight factors (Fig. [5](#F:5)), except for the number of target sites for the ectopically expressed miRNA or siRNA (#site_m) which showed decreased importance. This decrease can be explained, however, by TargetScan modeling total mRNA regulation as the sum of the scores for individual target sites; TargetScan scores (ts_score) and the number of target sites for the ectopically expressed miRNA or siRNA (#site_m) are strongly correlated (*r* = 0.42; p-value 2 = 0.093; adjusted R2 = 0.092) and TargetScan score combined with most other factors (except #site_m) showed significant coefficients (Fig. [S5]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S5) and Table [S20]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S20) in the Supplementary information). Together, these results show that although target site-dependent features, such as those modeled by TargetScan, are important for miRNA targeting, target mRNA, sample, and platform level features are also important for correctly interpreting miRNA high-throughput experiments. Specifically, in our analyses, target site-dependent and -independent features explain about the same amount of variation in target gene expression. #### &nbsp; {#F:6} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 6]({{ fig6 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig6[1] }}\"} ##### **Figure 6**. Coefficients of a linear regression with nine factors. {: .no_toc .text-caption } The dot plot shows the coefficients of the liner model with formula: -log ratio = ln3 + cs3 + exp +#site_m + #endo_m + #site_s + p_ma + e_oe + ts_score. The dot size shows -log10 of the coefficient’s p-value. Positive coefficients associate with miRNA down-regulation. {: .fs-2 } --- ### CpG frequency, and Developmental and Housekeeping genes: Overall gene expression is a major confounding factor when analyzing microarray data. {#S:3-16} As studies reported that miRNAs preferably target the high-CpG (CpGH) genes {% cite Sinha2008 -f {{ bib }} %} and developmentally regulated (Dev) genes {% cite Stefani2008 -f {{ bib }} %} and also tend to avoid targeting house-keeping (HK) genes {% cite Bartel2004 Stark2005 -f {{ bib }} %}, we expected the CpGH, Dev, and non-housekeeping (Non-HK) genes to be strongly down-regulated in the experimental data. To test miRNA down-regulation of these features, we split them into smaller sub-groups and used predicted miRNA or siRNA target genes to test whether any sub-group was more down-regulated than the others (Fig. [7]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S7)). As expected, the CpGH genes were significantly affected (Fig. [7]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S7)A; Tables [S21]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S21) in the Supplementary information), but we observed the opposite to the expected for the Dev and Non-HK genes (Fig. [7](#F:7)B,C; Tables [S22]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S22) and [S23]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S23) in the Supplementary information). Importantly, only the microarray data showed these unexpected differential effects. The proteomics data showed slightly stronger effects on the Dev and Non-HK genes, although only one of four comparisons was significant (Tables [S22]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S22) and [S23]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S23) in the Supplementary information). We therefore reasoned that the results could be related to the microarrays’ bias towards detecting differential expression among highly expressed genes. #### &nbsp; {#F:7} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 7]({{ fig7 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig7[1] }}\"} ##### **Figure 7**. CpG-rich genes, non-developmental genes, and house-keeping genes appear to be strong miRNA targets in microarray experiments. {: .no_toc .text-caption } We subdivided all RefSeq genes into sub-groups based on three different features: CpG frequency (CpG), and whether the genes were developmental (Dev) and house-keeping (HK) genes (see Methods). See Fig. [1](#F:1) for a description of the heat maps. {: .fs-2 } --- Consistent with this hypothesis, non-parametric tests to find the characteristics of CpG, HK, and Dev showed that CpGH and HK genes had more highly expressed genes than the other sub-groups and also showed that Dev genes had more lowly expressed genes (Table [4](#T:4)). We therefore concluded that the genes’ overall expression level was the major factor behind the observed differences within the CpG, Dev, and HK groups. --- #### **Table 4**. P-values of multiple Wilcoxon rank-sum tests on 3 miRNA target features for CpGH, House-keeping, and Developmental genes. {#T:4} {: .no_toc .text-caption } {% include tbl_simple.html data=tab4 %} Lower p-values in the Greater column indicate that the gene set of the Gene type overall has longer 3' UTR lengths, more conserved 3' UTRs, or stronger mRNA expression than has the rest of the human protein coding genes. Lower p-values in the Less column indicates the opposite characteristics; that is, shorter 3' UTR lengths, less conserved 3' UTRs, or lower mRNA expression. {: .fs-2 } --- ## Conclusions {#S:4} We analyzed the average regulatory effects that ectopically expressed miRNAs or siRNAs have on large gene sets and identified two strong factors. First, competition between endogenous miRNAs and the ectopically expressed RNAs have a strong impact on targets’ regulatory response. Genes with very long 3' UTRs, for example, are likely targeted by endogenous miRNAs and therefore less affected by exogenous miRNAs than are genes with shorter 3' UTRs. Second, target gene expression is a strong confounding factor when analyzing microarray experiments. Target genes with strong expression levels were significantly down-regulated compared to other expressed genes only in the microarray experiments. One explanation is that some genes are highly expressed simply because they are less targeted by endogenous miRNAs, and, therefore, ectopically expressed miRNAs have stronger down-regularly effects on these genes. Consistent with this explanation, miRNA transfection experiments give stronger target expression changes than do miRNA inhibition experiments. Another explanation is that microarrays, compared with high throughput proteomics, report significant expression data for many more lowly expressed genes. This technological difference means that microarrays can detect more differentially expressed genes than can high throughput proteomics. However, microarrays generally detect less differential expression for lowly expressed genes than for highly expressed genes. Consequently, microarrays will find a smaller fraction of the lowly expressed genes than of the highly expressed genes to be differentially expressed. The result is that when using microarray data to compare average down-regulation of miRNA-targets among house-keeping genes and developmentally regulated genes – genes that have high and low average expression levels, respectively – the average down-regulation is stronger for house-keeping genes than for developmental genes. This difference is contrary to the general consensus within the field {% cite Bartel2009 -f {{ bib }} %} and our analyses of high-throughput proteomics data which indicate that developmentally regulated genes are more likely miRNA targets than are house-keeping genes. Supporting this, our regression analysis shows that when such experiment-related confounding factors have been taken into account, miRNAs more effectively knock down lowly expressed than highly expressed genes. These results suggest that it is important to consider multiple factors when it comes to assessing miRNA targeting effects. One example of this relates to the so-called target dilution effect. A previous analysis has reported that the total expression level of target candidates for ectopically expressed miRNAs affects the targets’ average knockdown such that high total expression gives low average knockdown {% cite Arvey2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. Our analyses, however, show that some of this dilution effect can be explained by interactions with endogenous miRNAs. Consequently, it is very important to consider what genes are already targeted by endogenous miRNAs when designing and interpreting high throughput miRNA or siRNA experiments. In summary, our results can explain the results from several recent studies that have analyzed features that are important for miRNA regulation and found that the importance of 3' UTR length, conservation, and target gene expression depend on the technology used to measure miRNA targeting. Our results urge especial caution when using microarray data to compare average regulatory effects between groups of genes that have different average gene expression levels, such as high and low CpG genes and housekeeping and developmentally regulated genes. ## Methods {#S:5} ### Data retrieval {#S:5-1} **miRNA annotation and miRNA seed types**: We downloaded the annotations of human miRNAs, mature miRNAs, and miRNA families from miRBase (release 12.0) {% cite Griffiths-Jones2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. **Microarray and proteomics datasets**: We downloaded four microarray datasets, the Jackson {% cite Jackson2006 -f {{ bib }} %}, Lim {% cite Lim2005 -f {{ bib }} %}, Grimson {% cite Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, and Linsley {% cite Linsley2007 -f {{ bib }} %} from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database [GEO:GSE5814, GEO:GSE2075, GEO:GSE8501, GEO:GSE6838] {% cite Barrett2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, and two proteomics datasets, Selbach {% cite Selbach2008 -f {{ bib }} %} and Baek {% cite Baek2008 -f {{ bib }} %}, from the original publications along with the corresponding microarray datasets. In total, we used six microarray and two proteomics datasets. Samples from both microarray and proteomics used in this study are listed in Table [S2]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S2) in the Supplementary information. **3' UTR sequence and conservation**: We downloaded the RefSeq transcripts (hg18), human chromosome sequences, and multiz 17-way {% cite Blanchette2004 -f {{ bib }} %} for conserved sequences from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser {% cite Kent2002 -f {{ bib }} %}. The positional data used to generate nucleotide sequences were the exon positions from RefSeq for the 3' UTR region. We selected the longest 3' UTRs when a RefSeq entry had multiple transcripts. In addition to the human sequences, we generated 3' UTR sequences conserved in human, mouse, and rat (HMR) from multiz 17-way. **mRNA expression in HeLa**: We used replicate 1 of the ENCODE Caltech RNA-Seq data {% cite Birney2007 -f {{ bib }} %} from USCS for the mRNA expression in HeLa. **House keeping and developmental genes**: We obtained housekeeping genes from a list generated by a Naive Bayes classifier {% cite DeFerrari2006 -f {{ bib }} %}, and the developmental genes from the Gene Ontology [GO:0032502] {% cite Ashburner2000 -f {{ bib }} %}. **Endogenous miRNAs in HeLa**: We used the Mammalian microRNA Expression Atlas {% cite Landgraf2007 -f {{ bib }} %} to define the endogenous miRNAs in HeLa. For endogenous miRNAs, we selected the top 10 highly expressed miRNA families and used the miRNAs that belong to these miRNA families. We used three stringent seed types – 8mer, 7mer-A1, and 7mer-m8 – to search the candidate sites of the endogenous miRNAs. **PAR-CLIP**: We obtained PAR-CLIP high-throughput sequencing data of all four AGO proteins from the GEO database [GEO:GSE21918] {% cite Hafner2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. We used positional information downloaded with the sequence reads and mapped these positions on 3' UTR regions of all RefSeq genes. We considered 3' UTRs that had at least one site with the number of mapped reads greater than or equal to five to have an AGO binding site. ### Data preparation {#S:5-2} **Data preparation for microarray and proteomics data**: We used pre-processed data either from GEO or from the original publications. All log-ratio values that were pre-computed in log2 were transformed to log10. Log-ratio values of two inhibition experiments, Selbach LNA and Linsley OME, were negated because genes with positive log-ratio values were potential miRNA targets for these experiments. **Predicted miRNA or siRNA targets**: We separated the genes of each high throughput experiment by target prediction into “Target” and “Non-target” genes. The target prediction method we uses was a simple stringent seed search on the 3' UTRs and a gene was defined as a “Target” when the gene contained a seed site for the miRNA or siRNA used in the experiment. We used the previously described three stringent seed types, 8mer, 7mer-A1, and 7mer-m8, to define miRNA targets {% cite Bartel2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. **3' UTR sequence length**: For the 3' UTR sequence length, we made five sub-groups, Very Long (>4000 nts), Long (1373 ~ 4000 nts), Medium Long (630 ~ 1372 nts), Medium Short (248 ~ 629 nts), and Short (0 ~ 247 nts). The first group Very Long was decided from our previous study {% cite Saito2010 -f {{ bib }} %} because it showed that the genes with 3' UTR length longer than 4000 nucleotides were less targeted by miRNAs. We sorted the rest of the sequences by 3' UTR length and divided them into four equally sized sub-groups. **3' UTR sequence conservation**: For the 3' UTR sequence conservation, we calculated the conservation scores for each sequence by counting the number of conserved nucleotides in the HMR sequences and then divided the resulting number by the length of the sequence. We sorted the sequences with non-zero scores and divided them into three equal sub-groups; High (>0.238), Medium (0.054 ~ 0.238), and Low (0 ~ 0.238). The sequences with zero scores were categorized as NoConsv. **mRNA expression level**: We used the average number of tags from Caltech RNA-Seq as a measure (score) of mRNA expression levels. We sorted the mRNAs with non-zero expression scores by score and then divided them into five equally sized sub-groups; Very High (> 0.2007), High (0.0795 ~ 0.2007), Medium (0.0344 ~ 0.0795), Low (0.008 ~ 0.0344), and Very Low (0 ~ 0.008). The mRNAs with zero scores were categorized as NoExp. **CpG frequency in promoters**: We defined the promoter regions as 1000 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site. We used a moving window approach (500 nt window moving 5 nt at the time) to compute the CpG frequency and classified the CpG frequency as “high” when at least one 500-nucleotide-window contained >55% GC content and >75% CpG content, “low” when none of the windows contained >48% CpG content, and “medium” for the rest {% cite Weber2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. **House keeping and developmental genes**: We mapped house-keeping and developmental genes to based on gene IDs RefSeq genes. Non-house keeping and non-developmental genes were the rest of the RefSeq genes that were not mapped. **Endogenous miRNA targets**: We split “Target” and “Non-Target” genes into “With endogenous” and “Without endogenous” to make the T +Endo, T -Endo, NT +Endo, and NT -Endo gene groups, where “T” and “NT” represent “Target” and “Non-Target”, whereas “+Endo” and “-Endo” represent “With endogenous” and “Without endogenous”. We defined a gene as “With endogenous” when the gene was a predicted targeted for one or more of the top 10 most highly expressed endogenous miRNA families. The same approach as for predicting miRNA and siRNA targets was used to predict target genes for endogenous miRNAs. **Total mRNA expression levels and total number of target sites for the dilution effects**: We calculated both the total mRNA expression and the number of target transcripts as previously described {% cite Arvey2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. The total mRNA expression was a sample level sum of the average number of tags from Caltech RNA-Seq for predicted miRNA or siRNA target genes. The total number of target sites was a sample level sum of the number of target sites in predicted miRNA or siRNA target genes. **mRNA level TargetScan scores**: The stand alone version of TargetScan was downloaded from the TargetScan website ([http://www.targetscan.org](http://www.targetscan.org)). We then ran TargetScan on the 3' UTR sequences of the genes from the 10 miRNA high-throughput experiments with corresponding miRNA or siRNA sequences. The scores of target sites were aggregated by miRNA:mRNA pairs, and the aggregated scores were negated. Therefore, a high mRNA-level TargetScan score indicates that the mRNA is a strong candidate for miRNA down-regulation. ### Statistical analysis {#S:5-3} **Non-parametric tests**: We used the log-ratio values from 10 different experiments (Table S1 in the Supplementary information) that contain 140 different samples (Table [S2]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S2) in the Supplementary information) to measure the contributions of different groups to miRNA targeting efficacy. To test the significance level between multiple groups, we performed both one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum and one-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov non-parametric multiple comparison tests on the log-ratio values. **Sample level scores**: We performed non-parametric tests on 140 samples and counted the number of samples that had a significant p-value (<0.05) to calculate the proportion per experiment as Sample level score. **PAR-CLIP analysis**: We merged the five sub-groups of 3' UTR lengths into the two bigger groups long (Very Long and Long) and short (Med Long, Med Short, and Short) for all RefSeq genes and identified potential miRNA target genes bound by the four AGOs. The numbers of bound genes in the long and short groups were compared between each AGO and all RefSeq genes by Fisher's exact test. **Log2 enrichment of down-regulated genes**: The enrichment was calculated as the average log ratio values of down-regulated genes (p-value < 0.01 and log ratio < -0.01 for microarray, and log ratio < -0.01 for proteomics) divided by the average log-ratio values of all genes. **Linear regression**: All factors were normalized to the [0,1] value range before building linear regression models. The normalization was linear; that is, (feature value - min) / (max - min), where min and max values were defined for each factor as ln (min: -2.0, max: 2.0), ln3 (min: 0, max: 1000), cs3 (min:0, max: 1), exp (min:6.1e-5, max: 64.0), #site_m (min: 0, max: 20), #endo_m (min: 0, max: 30), #endo_s (min: 0, max: 6000), and ts_score (min: 0.0, max: 2.0). ## Additional files {#S:6} Additional file 1 – [Supplementary information]({{ page_suppl_info }}) [[PDF]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Saito_2012_Confounding_factors-supplementary_information.pdf)] \\ Additional file 1 contains [Supplementary Table]({{ page_suppl_info }}#S:1) S1-S23 and [Supplementary Figures]({{ page_suppl_info }}#S:2) S1-S5. ## Competing interests {#S:7} The authors declare that they have no competing interests. ## Authors' contributions {#S:8} All authors contributed to the underlying ideas of the method and the analysis.

This transcriptional regulation involves non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) overlapping or interacting with the target gene promoter, suggesting that ncRNAs overlapping protein-coding genes and forming complex loci may be important miRNA targets. Here, we have investigated miRNAs’ potential to regulate two such classes of complex loci: cis natural antisense (cis-NATs) ncRNAs and chromatin-associated RNAs (CARs). #### Results Resampling tests revealed that mRNAs overlapping cis-NATs and CARs tend to have longer and more conserved 3’UTRs than random genes and that the cis-NATs and CARs themselves are enriched with conserved miRNA target sites. Photoactivatable-Ribonucleoside-Enhanced Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) data confirmed several miRNA binding sites in these complex loci ncRNAs. Moreover, similar to PAR-CLIP target sites in 3’UTRs, but in contrast to sites in 5’UTRs and CDS, these ncRNA sites were strong and highly conserved. Correlation analyses of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles further showed that miRNA targeting of cis-NATs and intronic CARs, similar to 3’UTRs, have a negative effect on host mRNA expression. #### Conclusions Complex loci containing non-coding cis-NATs or CARs appear to be under strong miRNA regulation. Not only do miRNAs tend to target coding RNAs in complex more than other coding RNAs, but both sequence conservation and PAR-CLIP data show that miRNAs also target the complex loci ncRNAs. Indeed, expression data suggest that miRNA-targeting of non-coding cis-NATs and intronic CARs have a strong impact on host gene expression. ",

TOC {:toc} ## Abstract {#S:1} MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that can regulate many genes by base pairing to sites in mRNAs. The functionality of miRNAs overlaps that of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and many features of miRNA targeting have been revealed experimentally by studying miRNA-mimicking siRNAs. This review outlines the features associated with animal miRNA targeting and describes currently available prediction tools. ## Introduction {#S:2} MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were identified as a large sub-class of ncRNAs in 2001. Since then, an increasing number of studies have firmly established miRNAs' importance in gene regulation in general and animal development and disease in particular {% cite Ambros2004 Soifer2007 Croce2009 Stefani2008 Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. miRNAs regulate protein-coding genes post-transcriptionally by guiding a protein complex known as the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to messenger RNAs (mRNAs) with partial complementarity to the miRNA {% cite Carthew2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Through mechanisms not completely understood, RISC then inhibits protein translation and causes mRNA degradation {% cite Bartel2009 Filipowicz2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Current estimates indicate that miRNAs regulate at least 60% of the human protein-coding genes through this post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) {% cite Friedman2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Incorporated into RISC, miRNAs are functionally equivalent to short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) {% cite Hamilton1999 Zamore2000 -f {{ bib }} %}. The main difference between these RNAs is that miRNAs are processed from imperfect hairpin structures, whereas siRNAs are processed from long double-stranded RNAs {% cite Kim2009 Winter2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Moreover, animal miRNAs typically target imperfect sites, whereas siRNAs target sites with near-perfect complementarity. SiRNAs do target imperfect sites as well, however, and this miRNA-like targeting is the major source of siRNA off-target effects {% cite Birmingham2006 Jackson2006 Jackson2003 -f {{ bib }} %}. The list of known miRNAs is large and increasing. Currently, the official miRNA database miRBase lists 721 human miRNAs (; Release 14) {% cite Griffiths-Jones2008 -f {{ bib }} %}, but estimates indicate that the human genome contains more than 1000 miRNAs. As only a few regulatory targets are known, predicting and validating miRNA targets is one of the major hurdles in understanding miRNA biology. Here, we review the [features important for miRNA targeting](#S:3) and the [bioinformatics tools](#S:4) available for predicting miRNA targets. ## miRNA target features {#S:3} Identifying miRNA targets in animals has been very challenging. This is mainly because the limited complementarity between miRNAs and their targets, which might lead to the finding of hundreds of potential miRNA targets per miRNA. Therefore, many studies have been conducted, both experimentally and computationally, to reveal more efficient approaches for miRNA target recognition. We have divided the miRNA target features reported in these studies into six categories, [miRNA:mRNA pairing](#S:3a), [site location](#S:3b), [conservation](#S:3c), [site accessibility](#S:3d), [multiple sites](#S:3e) and [expression profile](#S:3f). ### miRNA:mRNA pairing: ‘Seed site’ is the most important feature for target recognition {#S:3a} miRNA targets commonly have at least one region that has Watson-Crick pairing to the 5' part of miRNA. This 5' part, located at positions 2-7 from the 5' end of miRNA, is known as the ‘seed’, as RISC uses these positions as a nucleation signal for recognizing target mRNAs {% cite Stark2003 Rajewsky2004 Lewis2003 -f {{ bib }} %}. The corresponding sites in mRNA are referred to as ‘seed sites’. A stringent-seed site has perfect Watson-Crick pairing and can be divided into four ‘seed’ types -- 8mer, 7mer-m8, 7mer-A1 and 6mer -- depending on the combination of the nucleotide of position 1 and pairing at position 8 (Fig. [1](#F:1)a). 8mer has both an adenine at position 1 of the target site and base pairing at position 8. 7mer-A1 has an adenine at position 1, while 7mer-m8 has base pairing at position 8. 6mer has neither an adenine at position 1 nor base pairing at position 8 {% cite Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. An adenine on the target site corresponding to position 1 of miRNA is known to increase efficiency of target recognition {% cite Lewis2005 -f {{ bib }} %}. #### &nbsp; {#F:1} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 1]({{ fig1 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig1[1] }}\"} ##### **Figure 1**. Types of miRNA target sites and multiple sites. {: .no_toc .text-caption } **(a)** Stringent-seed site. 7mer-A1 is shown as an example. Vertical lines indicate Watson-Crick paring. \\ **(b)** Moderate-stringent-seed site. BM is shown as an example. \\ **(c)** 3'-supplementary site. More than 3-4 nucleotide paring required. \\ **(d)** Optimal distance of two miRNA target sites. {: .fs-2 } --- In addition to this stringent-seed matching, moderate-stringent-seed matching is also functional because RISC can tolerate small mismatches or G:U wobble pairing within the seed region (Fig. [1](#F:1)b). This moderate-stringent-seed matching has five ‘seed’ types: GUM, GUT, BM, BT and LP, defined regarding to the mismatch type. GUM has one G:U wobble and the uracil on the seed site of miRNA, whereas GUT has the uracil on the target site of mRNA. BM has one bulge and the mismatch is on the seed site, whereas BT has the mismatch on the target site. LP has only one loop {% cite Gaidatzis2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. Furthermore, RISC can recognize offset sites that are located at positions 3-10. Offset sites can be either stringent or moderate-stringent-seed matching {% cite Hammell2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Watson-Crick pairing in the 3' part of miRNA is known to enhance the site recognition efficacy in miRNA targets that have seed pairing {% cite Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. The preferable nucleotide number of matches in the 3' part differs between the site that has stringent-seed pairing and the one that has moderate-stringent-seed pairing. Stringent-seeds require 3-4 matches in the positions 13-16, whereas moderate-stringent-seeds require 4-5 matches in the positions 13-19. Sites with this additional 3' pairing are called 3'-supplementary (Fig. [1](#F:1)c) and 3'-compensatory sites {% cite Bartel2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. It is difficult to measure the efficacy level of each seed type precisely, but several microarray and conservation enrichment studies have revealed hierarchies of relative efficacies. These hierarchies can be described as ‘Stringent seed’ > ‘Stringent seed in offset’ > ‘Moderate-stringent seed’ > ‘Moderate-stringent in offset’; 8mer > 7mer-m8 > 7mer-A1 > 6mer in the stringent-seed types; and Bulge > G:U wobble > Loop in the moderate-stringent-seed types {% cite Bartel2009 Hammell2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Moreover, multiple sites are more efficient than single sites {% cite Saetrom2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. The advantages and disadvantages of using different set of seed types are that considering only stringent-seed types increases specificity but might miss many potential targets, whereas considering both stringent and moderate-stringent-seed types increase sensitivity but might also increase the number of false positives. ### Site location: most target sites reside within 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target genes {#S:3b} Several studies have reported that most target sites can be found in the 3' UTR segment of the target genes, even though miRNA-loaded RISC in theory can bind any segment of mRNA. Target genes tend to have longer 3' UTR, whereas ubiquitously expressed genes, such as house-keeping genes, have shorter 3' UTR -- potentially to avoid being regulated by miRNAs {% cite Stark2005 -f {{ bib }} %}. Target sites are not evenly distributed within 3' UTR, but are located near both ends when the length of 3' UTR is ≥2000 nucleotides. For shorter 3' UTRs, sites tend to be near the stop codon {% cite Gaidatzis2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. Sites are not located too close to the stop codon, however, but 15-20 nucleotides away from the stop codon {% cite Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. In addition, some genes have alternative splicing in their 3' UTR segments, especially genes with long 3' UTRs. These genes might therefore have different potential target sites for alternatively spliced 3' UTRs {% cite Majoros2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. Finally, alternative polyadenylation sites can shorten 3' UTRs and affect miRNA regulation {% cite Sandberg2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Although functional miRNA sites are preferentially located in 3' UTR, seed sites in the coding sequence (CDS) and 5' UTR regions can also give downregulation {% cite Lytle2007 Kloosterman2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. Why does RISC then appear to prefer the 3' UTR? The most probable explanation is that RISC competes with other protein complexes, such as ribosomes in CDS and translation initiation complexes in 5' UTR; see discussion in the following section ‘[Multiple sites: cooperativity enhances site efficacy](#S:3e)’. The 3' UTR might simply be more accessible for long-term binding than the two other mRNA regions {% cite Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. Despite this general trend for 3' UTR targeting, there are some notable exceptions. One recent study reported that many miRNAs preferentially target 5' UTR sites with high complementarity to the miRNAs' 3' end in a species-specific manner {% cite Lee2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. The targets also showed signs of weaker interactions between the miRNA seed sequence and the 3' UTR. The authors proposed that these sites represented a new miRNA target class called ‘miBridge’, in which one miRNA simultaneously interacts with a seed pairing site in 3' UTR and a 3' pairing site in 5' UTR. The molecular mechanisms behind and the biological extent of these miBridge targets are still unknown, however. Most miRNA target prediction studies only focus on the 3' UTR, which results in that all the available data are biased toward 3' UTR. Moreover, few studies consider alternative splicing or polyadenylation because of shortcomings in current annotations. As transcript usage often depends on cellular context -- for example, whether the cell is proliferating or terminally differentiated -- future tools for miRNA target analyses should probably use available information about cellular state to increase prediction performance. ### Conservation: miRNAs and their targets are conserved among related species {#S:3c} miRNA families are comprised of miRNAs that have the same seed site, and are well conserved among related species. In addition, miRNA families have targets that are conserved among related species {% cite Friedman2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. There are also species-specific miRNAs and targets, and one study showed that about 30% of the experimentally validated target genes might not be well conserved {% cite Sethupathy2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. siRNA off-target effects occur no matter whether the site is conserved or not {% cite Burchard2009 -f {{ bib }} %}, therefore searching for all potential target sequences without considering evolutionally conservational might increase siRNA off-target detection efficacy. Applying a filter that requires predicted target sites to be conserved can decrease the false-positive rate, but such a filter is effective only for conserved miRNAs. It is important to identify targets both with and without conservation -- especially when species-specific miRNAs or siRNA off-targets is of interest. ### Site accessibility: mRNA secondary structure affects site accessibility {#S:3d} The mRNA secondary structure is very important for miRNA targeting. An effective miRNA:mRNA interaction needs an open structure on the target site to begin the hybridization reaction. After binding, RISC can disrupt the secondary structure on the site to elongate hybridization {% cite Long2007 Kertesz2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. Minimum free energy is usually used to estimate the secondary structure and RNA hybridization, but the amount of A:Us surrounding the site can also be used to estimate the site accessibility. Effective target sites often have A:U rich context in approximately 30 nucleotides upstream and downstream from the seed matching region of the target site {% cite Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. Calculating the minimum free energy of accessibility and hybridization with the mRNA secondary structure requires analyzing different mRNA folding patterns. This requires enormous amounts of computing power, as finding the most stable RNA structure is a computational problem that scales with the cube of the length of the RNA sequence {% cite Eddy2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. Hence, finding hybridization sites in long 3' UTRs tends to be time consuming. Moreover, the current thermodynamic models used in RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms are only 90-95% accurate, which results in that the algorithms tend to have only 50-70% of the base pairs correct {% cite Eddy2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. Thus, despite being theoretically sound, calculating site accessibility has limited practical value when predicting miRNA target sites; heuristics that are easy to compute, such as local A:U context, have similar performance. ### Multiple sites: cooperativity enhances site efficacy {#S:3e} Strong miRNA targets tend to have multiple target sites instead of one single site {% cite John2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. Considering the number of putative miRNA sites per mRNA can therefore significantly enhance target prediction. Although the general effect of multiple sites appears to be additive, miRNA targeting can also be synergistic. Our previous study showed that two target sites within optimal distance enhance target site efficacy. The preferable optimal length is between 17 and 35 nucleotides, but the length between 14 and 46 nucleotides also enhances the efficacy (Fig. [1](#F:1)d). This co-operability is functional between the same miRNAs as well as two different miRNAs {% cite Saetrom2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. Multiple sites involving more than two sites can also contribute to the enhancement {% cite Doench2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. The exact mechanism underlying the synergism remains unknown. As translational suppression is a relatively slow process compared with RISC's catalytic cleavage {% cite Haley2004 -f {{ bib }} %}, however, multiple RISC complexes bound at closely spaced target sites might cooperatively stabilize each other at the sites or possibly accelerate the regulatory process. This could explain why miRNAs prefer targets in 3' UTRs, as ribosomes would displace RISC from sites in CDS before RISC could effect translational suppression. Indeed, a cluster of rare codons that stall the ribosome can, when placed in front of a nonfunctional miRNA site in CDS, change the site to a functional site {% cite Gu2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Moreover, the genes that currently have verified miRNA target sites in CDS tend to have either one very strong target site {% cite Duursma2008 Elcheva2009 -f {{ bib }} %} or multiple, closely spaced sites {% cite Tay2008 Forman2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. ### Expression profile: miRNA:mRNA pairs are negatively correlated in expression profiles {#S:3f} One miRNA can potentially regulate many genes; therefore, expression profiles of mRNAs might vary substantially depending on the miRNA expression levels. Many miRNAs are also expressed differently in different tissues. Consequently, if negatively correlated expression levels of a miRNA:mRNA pair are detected across different tissue profiles, the mRNA of the pair is probably targeted by the miRNA {% cite Rajewsky2006 Lim2005 -f {{ bib }} %}. Filtering putative targets based on expression profile correlations is an effective approach to reduce the false-positive rate. Although the majority of miRNA targets appear to be regulated both at the mRNA and protein level, some targets only show an effect at the protein level, however {% cite Selbach2008 Baek2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Researchers should therefore be aware that such filtering will exclude potential targets. ## Target prediction tools {#S:4} Many target prediction tools have been developed (Table [1](#T:1)), but the types of methods applied, the miRNA and mRNA sequences used and the output prediction data and performance evaluation vary widely between tools. Direct comparison of prediction performance among tools is not straight forward because the set of predicted target genes from different tools do not overlap well. What is clear, however, is that conventional tools with simple stringent-seed search are prone to high false-positive rates. Therefore, most tools are designed to reduce the false-positive rate and maximize the accuracy at the same time. We have compared the currently available tools based on the target features the tools use in their predictions (Table [1](#T:1)), and the tools' availability (Table [2](#T:2)). Availability is especially important for researchers that are using their own miRNA or mRNA annotations, or are working in a nonstandard species. In these cases, only tools that can be downloaded or allows the user to input own miRNAs and mRNAs can be used. #### **Table 1**.

No tools have successfully incorporated some of the important features, such as optimal distances of multiple miRNA sites or supplementary sites in CDS and 5' UTR. TargetScan {% cite Friedman2009 Grimson2007 Lewis2005 -f {{ bib }} %}, PicTar {% cite Chen2006 Grun2005 Krek2005 Lall2006 -f {{ bib }} %} , miRanda {% cite John2004 Betel2008 -f {{ bib }} %}, RNAhybrid {% cite Kruger2006 Rehmsmeier2004 -f {{ bib }} %} and PITA {% cite Kertesz2007 -f {{ bib }} %} have been frequently used for performance comparisons or as preprocessors for other tools to obtain initial putative target sites. Of the five, TargetScan often shows the best performance in comparisons. TargetScan considers only stringent seeds, however, and therefore ignores many potential targets. ## Summary {#S:5} Finding true functional miRNA targets is still challenging even though many biological features of miRNA targeting have been revealed experimentally and computationally. Building a model with more features might achieve higher accuracy and enhance site recognition efficacy, but its implementation might also become more complex. None of the existing prediction tools has been able to incorporate all currently known features. We expect that a new approach that can combine the features from the six categories we have shown will significantly improve computational miRNA target prediction. Another important problem that has hardly been addressed is predicting target interactions between different miRNAs. Different miRNAs can cooperatively regulate individual targets, but miRNA expression signatures differ between cell types and cellular conditions. Determining how varying miRNA expression affects target regulation in cancerous versus normal cells, for example, will therefore be a major problem in the coming years. ## References {#S:6} {% bibliography --cited_in_order -f {{ bib }} %} ",

A two-step site and mRNA-level model for predicting microRNA targets. BMC Bioinformatics 11, 612 (2010). https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-612. {: .bg-grey-lt-000 .p-3 } {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} ## Supplementary Methods {#S:1} ### Data partition into positive (down-regulated) and negative genes {#S:1-1} Down-regulated (positive) genes of GEO datasets were defined as records with p-value 0.3 and log intensity ratio between -0.3 and 0.3, whereas up-regulated genes were defined as records with p-value 0.3. Negative records for the Birmingham dataset were defined as all RefSeq transcripts except the positive records. As a final filter, all miRNA:mRNA pairs that had either very high (>1.25) or very low ( 0. The records that do not fit in these criteria were not used in this study. ### Data retrieval for benchmarks {#S:1-2} Prediction data were downloaded from the Segal Lab site ([https://genie.weizmann.ac.il/pubs/mir07/](https://genie.weizmann.ac.il/pubs/mir07/)) for PITA All and PITA Top, the TargetScanHuman 5.1 site ([http://www.targetscan.org](http://www.targetscan.org)) for TargetScan and TargetScan with conserved genes, the MicroCosm Targets Version 5 site (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/enright-srv/microcosm) for miRanda, the miRDB site ([http://mirdb.org](http://mirdb.org)) for mirTarget2, and the PicTar WEB INTERFACE site ([https://pictar.mdc-berlin.de/](https://pictar.mdc-berlin.de/)) for PicTar. Several methods provide only target site level scores for download, and, in that case, summation methods showed in the web sites or in the original publications were applied to obtain scores for the mRNA level. For siRNA predictions, PITA and TargetScan executable programs were downloaded and used to calculate prediction scores. ### Performance evaluation on independent dataset {#S:1-3} Six dataset – “ROC with All genes”, “ROC10*n”, “ROC with 7mer + Conservation”, and three method-specific datasets for TargetScan, miRanda, and PicTar – were created for evaluation. The “ROC with All genes” dataset was comprised of all the records from the microarray dataset. “ROC10\\*n” was based on the standard ROC50 {% cite Gribskov1996 -f {{ bib }} %} benchmark. The ROC50 benchmark score is the area under the ROC curve until 50 negatives are found. Consequently, the “ROC10\\*n” benchmark datasets consisted of all the true positives found in the microarray experiments and the 10*n first negatives found by each method benchmarked. The “ROC with 7mer + Conservation” dataset was comprised of genes with conserved 8mer or 7mer-m8 or 7mer-A1 sites. Sites were defined as conserved if the average phyloP 44 scores in the seed region were > 0.9. The three method-specific datasets for TargetScan, miRanda, and PicTar were generated by only using the records from the microarray experiments that had corresponding predictions for each method. ## Supplementary Results {#S:2} ### Analysis of target site level training data: Selection of seed types influences the coverage of potential target sites {#S:2-1} Current methods for miRNA target prediction base their analyses on identifying so-called seed sites in 3' UTR. The definition of seed types varies from one prediction algorithm to another {% cite Gaidatzis2007 Grimson2007 Hammell2008 -f {{ bib }} %}, however, and this heavily influences the coverage of potential target sites. Lower coverage means that predictions may lack many true positive sites, whereas higher coverage may result in poor accuracy because of too many false positive sites. Based on four different microarray datasets - Birmingham {% cite Birmingham2006 -f {{ bib }} %}, Jackson {% cite Jackson2006 -f {{ bib }} %}, Lim {% cite Lim2005 -f {{ bib }} %}, and Grimson {% cite Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, we identified a set of 823 genes that were down-regulated in response to artificial miRNA or siRNA transfection, or up-regulated in response to miRNA inhibition (see [Supplementary Methods](#S:1-1)). This positive set of genes constituted 0.14% of the 571570 potential miRNA:gene interactions assayed in the microarray experiments. Searching for seed sites among the positive genes identified that 347 and 510 genes contained stringent and all types of seed sites. Thus, basing miRNA target predictions on stringent seeds or all seed types would cover 42% or 62% of the positive genes. The corresponding numbers for the negative set of 570747 genes were 128254 and 31277. Consequently, the predictive accuracy, as measured by the positive predictive value (PPV = True positive predictions / All positive predictions), was almost three times greater for stringent seeds (PPV = 1.1%) than for all seed types (PPV = 0.40%). Even so, this showed that predicting miRNA targets purely based on identifying stringent seed sites would give too many false positive predictions to be viable in practice. Several approaches have shown that other target-related features besides the seed type and additional data such as miRNA and mRNA expression profiles can improve predictive accuracy {% cite Huang2007 Sales2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. We therefore chose to include all seed types to achieve high coverage in the training data and then improve the accuracy through two-step SVM training. ### Prediction of targets with optimal distance sites: Optimal distance is effectively incorporated in our SVM prediction {#S:2-2} We were interested to see how well the features of optimal distances were incorporated into our algorithm. Our model uses two mRNA features that represent optimal distances: (i) the number of sites that have other neighboring sites within 13-46 nt and (ii) the number of sites that have other neighboring sites within 17-25 nt. Furthermore, one target site level feature, “distance to the next target” could be effective to recognize the targets with optimal distance. However, these features showed little contribution when the influence of both target site and mRNA level features was analyzed (Tables [S2](#T:S2) and [S4](#T:S4)). Therefore, we applied a different approach as to see the difference of prediction power between the target genes with optimal distance and other target genes. First, we categorized all potential targets into four different target types, which were defined by the number of potential target sites, seed types, and existence of optimal distance sites within the gene’s 3’ UTR. “Single non-stringent” and “Single stringent” were targets that had only one “non-stringent” and “stringent” seed site, whereas “Multiple without optimal distance” and “Multiple with optimal distance” were targets that had multiple sites where none or at least one pair of sites were within . Then, we checked the mRNA level classifier’s distributions of discriminant values for these four target types. The resulting box plots (Fig. [S10](#F:S10)) show that for each target type, the mRNA-level SVM clearly separates between the positive (down-regulated) and negative (non-down-regulated) targets. Moreover, targets with multiple sites had higher discriminant values than targets with single stringent and single non-stringent sites, and the targets with optimally spaced sites had the highest discriminant values. Thus, site distance contributed positively to the SVM’s predictions. ### Site accessibility and sequence conservation: Explicit usage of site accessibility and sequence conservation do not improve SVM prediction {#S:2-3} Although target site accessibility is important for both miRNA and siRNA targeting {% cite Kertesz2007 Long2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, it is unclear how useful computational predictions of target site accessibility are for genome-wide miRNA target analyses {% cite Baek2008 Hammell2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. Similarly, even though many target prediction tools rely on conserved sequences, as these indicate conserved function and targeting, sequences with little or no evidence of conservation can still be functional target sites {% cite Sethupathy2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. Moreover, calculating target site accessibility and conservation features demand much higher computational power and resources than calculating the other features. Therefore, we constructed classifiers without using the site accessibility and sequence conservation features to evaluate their importance in our SVM model. To evaluate the classifier without of site accessibility and sequence conservation features, we compared the ROC scores of three mRNA level classifiers that used the same mRNA level features, but three different target site classifiers; that is, classifiers (i) without site accessibility and conservational information, (ii) with site accessibility, and (iii) with conservational information. The classifiers were then tested on the independent dataset. All the results from the 10-fold cross-validation and independent tests showed very little difference among the three classifiers (Fig. [S11](#F:S11)). Although theoretically sound, the computationally intensive accessibility predictions could therefore, in practice, be eliminated from the SVM classifier. In addition, although many miRNA target sites appear to be well conserved, the small influence of the conservation-related features on SVM performance indicate that many non-conserved miRNA targets exist. This is consistent with the results of the benchmarks of the 8 existing miRNA target prediction methods. Consequently, the proportion of non-conserved miRNA target sites in the set of all potential target sites seems too large to be ignored. Therefore, we opted to train our SVM classifiers without using site accessibility and sequence conservation. ### Classification vs. Regression: Support vector classification (SVC) performs better than support vector regression (SVR) {#S:2-4} The microarray data used in our experiments measured actual changes in gene expression in response to miRNA or siRNA over-expression. Consequently, even though we treated miRNA target prediction as a classification problem, target prediction could also be solved as a regression problem. To test whether treating target prediction as a regression problem would further improve our predictions, we used the PyML library to train SVR models to fit the log ratio values from the Jackson, Lim, and Grimson microarray experiments. We did not use the Birmingham dataset because pre-processed log ratio values were not available. The SVR models used the same two step approach and the same features as our previous SVC models. The same optimization approach as we used for the SVC models showed that a linear kernel with default parameters gave the best predictions at both the target site and mRNA level. This model selection often resulted in over-fitting or no convergence, however, hence requiring more analysis time than SVC to find an optimal kernel. Moreover, the SVR target site and mRNA level models showed lower prediction performance at the 10-fold cross-validation and independent data set than the SVC models did (Fig. [S12](#F:S12)). Thus, when the input is based on features derived from the target sequence, classification models are as good or better at predicting miRNA or siRNA target gene expression fold changes as are regression models. ### Dataset selection: Different parameters for constructing training or test data do not affect SVM prediction performance {#S:2-5} It is important to verify that our SVM approach is still effective when we select different positive (down-regulated) and negative (non-down-regulated) datasets for both training and test because it proves that our SVM approach is not optimized only for a certain parameter criteria of data selection. We generated seven different datasets; one for training and six for independent test sets to further investigate SVM prediction power with different data selection parameters. Two major steps applied to create datasets in our study were; (i) all microarray datasets were separated into three groups; down-regulated, unaffected and up-regulated, depending of the log ratio values, and (ii) positive data were selected from down-regulated genes, whereas negative records were from both unaffected and up-regulated genes. However, some miRNAs are known to potentially up-regulate genes. The mechanism of this up-regulation is unknown, and the features of up-regulated target sites/genes are possibly quite different from those of miRNAs involved in down-regulation. To check the influence of involving these up-regulated genes in our SVM training sets, we constructed a dataset without up-regulated genes, and trained and tested it on the independent datasets. The 10-fold cross-validation ROC plots for both target site and mRNA level classifiers trained without up-regulated genes (Fig. [S13](#F:S13) A, C) were almost identical to those trained with up-regulated genes (Fig. [S13](#F:S13) E, G). The prediction power was also retained when the classifiers were tested on the Linsley dataset (Fig. [S13](#F:S13) B, D) and compared with those trained with up-regulated genes (Fig. [S13](#F:S13) F, H). Moreover, we generated six independent subsets for one transcriptomics (Linsley) and two proteomics (Selbach and Baek) experiments.

TOC {:toc} ## Abstract {#S:1} ### Background {: .no_toc } Despite experiments showing that the number of microRNA (miRNA) target sites is critical for miRNA targeting, most existing methods focus on identifying individual miRNA target sites and do not model contributions of multiple target sites to miRNA regulation. To address this possible fault, we developed a miRNA target prediction model that recognizes the individual characteristics of functional binding sites and the global characteristics of miRNA-targeted mRNAs. ### Results {: .no_toc } Benchmark experiments showed that this two-step model generally had a higher overall performance than other established miRNA target prediction algorithms and that the model was especially suited to identify true miRNA targets among genes that all contain conserved target sites. ### Conclusions {: .no_toc } This improved performance could partly be explained by the model not relying on conservation when predicting targets. The critical factors for the model’s performance, however, were mRNA-level features that characterized the number and strength of individual target sites within the mRNA. The model is available for online predictions or as pre-computed predictions on the human genome (http://tare.medisin.ntnu.no/mirna_target). ## Background {#S:2} MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that can regulate many protein coding genes by base-paring to messenger RNA (mRNA) targets {% cite Bartel2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. Their roles in gene regulation have been identified in numerous biological processes, such as developmental timing, apoptosis, and cell proliferation {% cite Ambros2004 Stefani2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. The precise mechanism of miRNA targeting is unknown, but animal miRNAs have a small region called ”seed” site (Figure [1](#F:1)), which is located at positions 2-7 of the 5' end of miRNAs and is known to contribute to target recognition significantly {% cite Rajewsky2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. Most target sites are found in the mRNA 3' untranslated region (UTR) {% cite Bartel2004 Lim2005 Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %} and are well conserved among closely related species {% cite Ambros2004 -f {{ bib }} %}. A high number of coding genes, except for those with short 3' UTRs such as house keeping genes, are likely regulated by one or multiple miRNAs {% cite Stark2005 -f {{ bib }} %}. #### &nbsp; {#F:1} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 1]({{ fig1 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig1[1] }}\"} ##### **Figure 1**. miRNA seed types. {: .no_toc .text-caption } Nine seed types are categorized in two groups; “Stringent” (8mer, 7mer-A1, and 7mer-m8) and “Non-stringent” (6mer, GUM, GUT, LP, BM and BT). GUM and GUT allow one GU wobble in the seed region. GUM has the U on miRNA whereas GUT has the U on the target. LP, BM and BT allow one mismatch. LP has one loop, BM has one bulge on miRNA, and BT has one bulge on the target. {: .fs-2 } --- Because of the important genome-wide regulatory roles of miRNAs, many computational approaches have been developed to obtain high-throughput genome-wide miRNA target predictions in animals {% cite Rajewsky2006 Bartel2009 Saito2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. Most existing algorithms first perform sequence search on 3' UTRs to find regions that have complementarity to miRNAs preferably at their seed sites. As this initial step usually results in thousands of potential target sites and many false positives, most algorithms take additional features into consideration; for example, evolutionary conservation filters can decrease the false positive rate, but such filters are effective only for conserved miRNAs with sites of conserved function. Several other features have been experimentally and computationally identified, and we have categorized them into two groups: (i) individual target site level features and (ii) global mRNA level features. The six target site level features currently known are (i.a) site conservation, (i.b) additional base paring in 3' portion of miRNA, especially at positions 13-16 of miRNA {% cite Lewis2003 Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, (i.c) AU-rich context within 30 nucleotides upstream and downstream from the seed site {% cite Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, (i.d) avoidance of the region from the stop codon to 15nt downstream in 3' UTR {% cite Grimson2007 Majoros2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, (i.e) tendency of targeting near both ends of 3' UTR when the length of the 3' UTR is >2000 {% cite Gaidatzis2007 Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, and (i.f) site accessibility {% cite Kertesz2007 Long2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. Furthermore, there are three known mRNA level features: (ii.a) high cooperativity of two miRNA target sites when the distance between them is 17-35 nt {% cite Saetrom2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, (ii.b) length of 3' UTR {% cite Rajewsky2006 -f {{ bib }} %}, and (ii.c) the number of potential target sites per 3' UTR {% cite Enright2003 -f {{ bib }} %}. Although some algorithms base their predictions on only one of these additional features, such as conservation {% cite Gaidatzis2007 -f {{ bib }} %} or accessibility {% cite Kertesz2007 Long2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, the algorithms commonly use different combinations of features {% cite Saito2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. Most existing algorithms focus on identifying individual target sites, however; few model miRNA targeting at the level of the mRNA and only PicTar tries to explicitly model the contribution of multiple target sites to miRNA regulation {% cite Krek2005 -f {{ bib }} %}. Here, we describe a novel two-step classification model that recognizes the individual characteristics of functional binding sites and the global properties of mRNAs regulated by candidate miRNAs. We base the model on support vector machines (SVM) {% cite Vapnik1998 -f {{ bib }} %}, use large-scale microarray datasets to train and test the model, and benchmark the model against five popular algorithms – TargetScan {% cite Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, miRanda (MicroCosm) {% cite Enright2003 Griffiths-Jones2008 -f {{ bib }} %}, PicTar, PITA {% cite Kertesz2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, and mirTarget2 {% cite Wang2008 -f {{ bib }} %}. As these five algorithms represent different prediction strategies and can have different strengths and weaknesses, we have used six different benchmarks that account for overall predictions, highly specific predictions, predictions of conserved sites, and method-specific data variations. Our method performs better than or equivalent to the other existing algorithms in the six benchmarks when tested on different cross-validation experiments or on an independent test set. ## Results and Discussion {#S:3} Our goal was to create and test a miRNA target prediction approach that modeled both the characteristics of individual target sites and the global properties of mRNAs regulated by candidate miRNAs. Although there are few experimentally validated miRNA targets, several datasets from microarray experiments where miRNAs were ectopically expressed are available for public use {% cite Lim2005 Grimson2007 Linsley2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. High-throughput proteomics experiments have shown that most miRNA targets are regulated at both the mRNA and protein level {% cite Baek2008 Selbach2008 -f {{ bib }} %}, which means that these microarray data are relevant and useful for developing miRNA targeting models. In addition, there are several microarray experiments for small interfering RNA (siRNA) off-target effects {% cite Birmingham2006 Jackson2006 -f {{ bib }} %}. Transfected siRNAs are known to act like miRNAs {% cite Hamilton1999 Zamore2000 -f {{ bib }} %} and degrade numerous unintended (off-target) mRNAs. Consequently, microarray datasets for siRNA off-targets can be used to reveal aspects of miRNA regulation. Unlike miRNA target sites, however, off-target sites for such artificial and exogenous siRNAs are not evolutionary conserved. We collected four such microarray datasets – two miRNA and two siRNA datasets – to use as training data to develop our method. Based on an analysis of how different seed types covered the positive and negative target candidates within these datasets (see Additional file 1:[Supplementary Results]({{ page_suppl_info }}#S:2-1)), we chose to develop a target-site model that included both stringent and non-stringent seed sites. Our hypothesis was that by including non-stringent seed sites and training two separate SVMs on target site and mRNA-level features, we would create an accurate miRNA target prediction method with high sensitivity and overall prediction performance. ### SVM prediction performs well with target site features {#S:3-1} The first step of our two-step SVM classification approach was to construct a target site level classifier that can separate positive target sites from negative target sites. To construct this target site level classifier, we included several features known or presumed predictive of miRNA targeting (Additional file 1:Table [S1]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S1)). Four sub-steps were applied and then iterated until the most effective classifier was found. First, 10-fold cross-validation was performed to evaluate the prediction ability. Second, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to visualize the result of the 10-fold cross-validation and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used as a performance measure. The ROC curve and its AUC value, or “ROC score”, is a simple but powerful measure of overall classification performance as the curve shows a classifier’s sensitivity and specificity across all thresholds. Third, as an SVM can take both linear and non-linear kernels with different parameters, models with different kernels were assessed. Fourth, to check the classifier’s robustness across different experimental settings, classifiers were constructed from only three microarray experiments instead of four and tested on the remaining microarray set. These iterative tests found that a classifier with non-linear, homogeneous polynomial kernel (parameters degree 5 and cost factor 2) showed the best performance with the ROC score 0.70 (Figure [2](#F:2)A). The small standard errors in the ROC plot indicated that all classifiers from this 10-fold cross-validation had similar prediction power and that the models gave robust classifications. This conclusion was supported by similar results for models trained on three of the four microarray experiments (Additional file 1:Figure [S1]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S1)). Moreover, all the four classifiers from different combinations of three microarray datasets could classify the remaining one dataset with good ROC scores (Figure [3](#F:3)A-D). These results indicated that our target site level classifiers were stable and accurate across experimental conditions, irrespective of whether the sequences were miRNAs or siRNAs. #### &nbsp; {#F:2} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 2]({{ fig2 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig2[1] }}\"} ##### **Figure 2**.

Figure headings state the dataset used for testing. {: .fs-2 } --- ### Seed type shows the strongest influence on target site level training {#S:3-2} It is important to identify the influence of the features on the SVM’s prediction accuracy, as this can reveal new information about miRNA target recognition. To evaluate the influence of all the target site level features used in our model, 10-fold cross-validation was performed repeatedly with eliminating only one feature at a time, and then ROC scores were compared. These experiments showed that the “seed type” was the strongest feature with a reduced ROC score of 0.03 (Additional file 1:Table [S2]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S2)). Reduced ROC scores indicate that the feature is important, as the SVM would have more prediction power with the feature included. Other features showed little or no decline of ROC scores, but none had substantial negative effects. ### Genes with long 3' UTRs tend to have few positive target sites in microarray experiments {#S:3-3} While constructing and analyzing the mRNA level training data, we noticed that genes with more than 8 potential target sites appeared to be underrepresented among the positives. This was contrary to our expectations, as experimental data indicate that additional target sites give increased target repression {% cite Doench2003 -f {{ bib }} %}. Additional analyses revealed two trends. First, genes with long 3' UTRs (>5000nt) did generally not appear to be miRNA targets – irrespective of the genes’ number of potential miRNA target sites (Figure [4](#F:4)). Second, positive targets generally had a higher density of potential target sites (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p-value: 4e-11) – that is, number of sites divided by the 3' UTR length – than negative target candidates had (Additional file 1:Figure [S2]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S2)). #### &nbsp; {#F:4} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 4]({{ fig4 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig4[1] }}\"} ##### **Figure 4**. Fewer positive target sites for genes with long 3' UTRs. {: .no_toc .text-caption } The boxplot shows the lengths of 3' UTRs grouped by the number of potential target sites in the training dataset. Red boxes represent down regulated UTRs, whereas blue boxes represent unaffected UTRs. No down-regulated genes have more than 8 potential target sites and few down-regulated genes have long 3' UTRs (>5000nt). The range of potential target site number is from 1 to 28 plus 32 and 38. {: .fs-2 } --- One possible explanation for this result is competition between transfected RNAs and endogenous miRNAs {% cite Khan2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Genes with long 3' UTRs tend to be targeted by several endogenous miRNAs, therefore the transfected RNAs may have less effect on these genes. Another possible explanation for this result is that genes with long 3' UTRs have fewer target sites within these active regions because active sites are preferentially located close to the stop codon or poly-A site within long 3' UTRs {% cite Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. However, we found that the positive targets and negative target candidates had a similar number of target sites within the regions close to the stop codon and poly-A site (data not shown). Thus, a high density of target sites within the middle region of long 3' UTRs appeared to be important for target regulation. We used two approaches to take this unexpected distribution of true positive targets into consideration. First, a new binary feature was introduced to distinguish the genes with less than 7 potential target sites from the others. Second, 1000 randomly selected non-target genes with more than 7 target sites were explicitly added to the training data. Because of a practical limitation on the maximum number of training data, most of these none-target genes with long 3' UTRs would otherwise have been excluded if we had constructed the training data by random sampling. These two approaches had a positive effect on target predictions for genes with many target site candidates (Additional file 1:Figure [S3]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S3)). ### mRNA features improve SVM predictions {#S:3-4} The second step of our two-step SVM classification approach was to construct an mRNA level classifier that can separate down-regulated genes from non down-regulated genes. This subdivision enabled us to incorporate features related to the predicted strength of individual target sites and the distance between these sites that had not been used in other algorithms before (Additional file 1:Table [S3]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S3)). We used the same four steps as for the target site level to find the most effective mRNA level classifier. The classifier showed the best performance when a linear kernel with default parameters was used (ROC score 0.80). As for the target site level, the ROC curve for the classifier had small standard errors, indicating robust classifications (Figure [2](#F:2)B). Target predictions also retained good performance with classifiers trained with only three microarray datasets (Additional file 1:Figure [S4]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S4)). These classifiers could also predict the remaining data set with good accuracy (Figure [3](#F:3)E-H), but the classifiers showed increased variation between the datasets compared with the corresponding target site level classifiers. Whereas the mRNA level classifiers greatly improved upon the target site level classifiers’ performance on the miRNA data (compare panels B and F, and D and H in Figure [3](#F:3)), the mRNA level classifiers gave smaller improvements on the siRNA data (panels A and E, and C and G in Figure [3](#F:3)). Thus, the targets for exogenous siRNAs were more difficult to predict than the targets for endogenous miRNAs were – at least in the datasets used in these experiments. This could not be explained by different preferences for strand loading between the miRNAs and siRNAs, as removing the siRNAs where the intended guide strand was not clearly preferred for RISC incorporation did not improve the SVM’s performance (data not shown). Despite these differences, the mRNA level classifier showed good improvement compared with the target site level classifier and could predict target genes with high accuracy. ### Number and strength of putative miRNA target sites strongly predict miRNA regulation {#S:3-5} As for the target site level features, we wanted to determine to what extent the different mRNA level features influenced target predictions. We therefore performed a similar evaluation of feature influence for the mRNA level. The result showed that the “distribution of discriminant values” was the strongest feature with a reduced ROC score of 0.04 (Additional file 1:Table [S4]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S4)). Eliminating other features had little effect on the ROC scores, but additional analyses showed that at least the target-site distance features contributed to separate the down-regulated from the unaffected genes (see Additional file 1:[Supplementary Results]({{ page_suppl_info }}#S:2-2)). As the “distribution” feature essentially counted the number of high-scoring putative target sites within the mRNA, these results showed that strong target sites are important for miRNA regulation. The target site level feature analyses indicated that target site accessibility and conservation had little or no effect on the SVM’s predictive performance and additional analyses at the mRNA level confirmed these results (see Additional file 1:[Supplementary Results]({{ page_suppl_info }}#S:2-3)). As computing site accessibility and conservation require substantial computational resources, we excluded these features from the final model. Recently, a tool based on support vector regression (SVR) reported improved target prediction performance {% cite Betel2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. We also tested whether using SVR instead of classification would further improve the results, but instead found that SVR gave reduced performance (see Additional file 1:[Supplementary Results]({{ page_suppl_info }}#S:2-4)). ### Two-step SVM shows strong prediction ability and outperforms other algorithms when tested on independent dataset {#S:3-6} Both the 10-fold cross-validation and single dataset hold-out experiments showed that the two-step SVM classifiers could predict miRNA target sites in unseen data with high accuracy. Nevertheless, to further test the SVM classifiers, we evaluated the classifiers on an independent test set and compared their performance with those of other existing target prediction algorithms. We included seven popular miRNA target prediction algorithms – PITA All, PITA Top, TargetScan, TargetScan with conserved genes, miRanda (MicroCosm), mirTarget2, and PicTar – in the comparisons, and used the Linsley dataset because only mirTarget2 had used this microarray dataset as a training set. The predictions of three algorithms – our SVM approach, PITA All, and TargetScan – were generated without conservation information, but the predictions of the other algorithms were generated with conservation information as features or filters. We included mirTarget2 as a reference – despite mirTarget2 using the Linsley dataset for training – because the algorithm, similar to our two-step SVM, adopted a machine learning approach. The algorithms’ predictions had little overlap because all algorithms used different definitions of potential target sites. Hence, it was important to use different datasets to assess and compare the algorithms’ prediction performance precisely. We used six types of datasets as benchmarks; these were, ROC with All genes, ROC10*n, ROC with 7mer + Conservation, and ROC with TargetScan, miRanda, and PicTar datasets (see Additional file 1:[Supplementary Methods]({{ page_suppl_info }}#S:1-3)). The “ROC with All genes” dataset was comprised of all the records from the microarray dataset. Down regulated (positive) and unaffected (negative) genes were decided solely by the microarray results regardless of seed matching or any other definitions set by different algorithms. The purpose of using this dataset was to evaluate the algorithms’ overall performance on the entire microarray experiment. The resulting ROC curves showed that our SVM approach outperformed the other seven algorithms in terms of sensitivity and overall target recognition (Figure [5](#F:5)A). The number of positive genes found by our SVM approach was 564, which was the largest among all the algorithms (Additional file 1:Table [S5]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S5)). In comparison, PITA All found a similar number of positive genes, but its predictions were less specific than our SVM’s predictions were. At similar true positive rates, PITA All returned more false positives, which resulted in a difference in ROC score of 0.05 between SVM and PITA All. Similar to PITA, miRanda returned less specific predictions than the other algorithms did, although miRanda’s predictions were more specific than PITA All’s at similar true positive rates. miRanda also had the lowest sensitivity of the different algorithms. Apart from differences in sensitivity, the remaining algorithms had similar prediction specificities; mirTarget2 appeared to give slightly more specific predictions than the other algorithms did, but our SVM appeared to have the highest specificity of the methods for which the Linsley set truly was an independent test set. These differences were small, however, and only apparent for the algorithms’ most sensitive predictions. #### &nbsp; {#F:5} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 5]({{ fig5 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig5[1] }}\"} ##### **Figure 5**. Benchmarks show the performances of 8 different prediction algorithms. {: .no_toc .text-caption } Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) graphs show the performances of 8 different target prediction algorithms – SVM, PITA All (PITA), PITA Top (PITA_top), TargetScan (TargetS), TargetScan with conserved genes (TargetS_c), MicroCosm miRanda (miRanda), mirTarget2 and PicTar – on the Linsley dataset. Dotted lines illustrate random prediction. The ROC scores are shown in the legend box. The benchmarks used for the evaluation were **(A)** ROC with All genes, **(B)** ROC10*n, and **(C)** ROC with 7mer + Conservation. {: .fs-2 } --- To elucidate the algorithms’ performance at highly specific target predictions, we turned to the “ROC10\\*n” benchmark (Figure [5](#F:5)B), which is a modified version of ROC50 {% cite Gribskov1996 -f {{ bib }} %} that shows the algorithms’ performance up to 10 \\* n false positive predictions (n is the number of miRNAs in the dataset; n = 9 for the Linsley set). Although the SVM’s ROC10\\*n score is slightly lower than those of the two TargetScan versions and mirTarget2, the SVM again has the highest sensitivity of the algorithms (excluding mirTarget2 and PicTar). Similarly, PITA All again shows very low sensitivity, whereas PicTar and miRanda have similar performance. Thus, the results from the ROC10*n benchmark indicate that our SVM approach has very good performance with top scored genes (Figure [5](#F:5)B). As many of the algorithms only considered stringent seed types and filtered predictions based on conservation, we constructed the “ROC with 7mer + Conservation” benchmark. The benchmark only consisted of the genes with stringent seeds found in conserved regions. Consequently, the benchmark essentially only considered the most likely candidate miRNA target genes and showed how good the different algorithms are at finding the real targets among genes that all are likely targets. Despite that our approach was not optimized for this type of dataset, the SVM delivered more sensitive and specific predictions than the other methods (Figure [5](#F:5)C; again excluding mirTarget2). Interestingly, the algorithms optimized for recognizing conserved stringent seed targets – TargetScan with conserved genes, PITA Top and PicTar – all had markedly lower performance than the SVM. One likely explanation for this result is that other non-conserved seeds within the genes are important for miRNA targeting as well. Supporting this hypothesis, TargetScan – which also considers non-conserved seeds – had a markedly better performance than TargetScan with conserved genes. miRanda showed especially poor performance on the conservation benchmark, but this was likely because the miRanda predictions had very few overlaps with the benchmark dataset due to different conservation filtering. Indeed, miRanda had better performance on its method-specific benchmarks (Additional file 1:Figure [S5]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S5), [S7]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S7), and [S9]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S9). The three method-specific benchmarks that use different definitions of sequence conservation and separate benchmark tests on the four training datasets also showed similar results as the 7mer + Conservation benchmark (Additional file 1:Figure [S5]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S5)-[S9]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S9)). Thus, lack of conservation does not guarantee lack of function, and effectively incorporating all seed types in a common prediction framework, such as our SVM, appears to be essential for correctly prioritizing lists of candidate miRNA targets. ### Two-step SVM’s improved performance holds when detecting protein level targets {#S:3-7} Although several recent studies have suggested the possibility of mRNA repression as miRNA’s major regulatory mode {% cite Baek2008 Selbach2008 -f {{ bib }} %}, it is still interesting to verify the prediction power at both mRNA and protein levels. We therefore used two publically available proteomics datasets of miRNA targeting, Baek {% cite Baek2008 -f {{ bib }} %} and Selbach {% cite Selbach2008 -f {{ bib }} %}, as training sets to create a new proteomics-based two-step SVM classifier and as independent datasets to test the mRNA-based two-step SVM classifier. The proteomics-based SVM showed comparable performance to the mRNA-based SVM (Additional file 1:Figure [S14]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S14)), which indicated that features important for predicting mRNA-level miRNA targets are also relevant for predicting protein-level targets. Indeed, when we benchmarked the mRNA-based classifiers against the Selbach and Baek datasets, the SVM outperformed the other seven algorithms in most cases and especially on the ROC10*n benchmarks (Figure [6](#F:6); Table [1](#T:1)). Note that on these two sets, which were true independent test sets for mirTarget2 and therefore should be more representative of the method’s performance than the Linsley set, mirTarget2 had similar or slightly lower performance than the two TargetScan versions. These results as well as additional benchmark results (Additional file 1:Figure [S15]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S15), [S16]({{ page_suppl_info }}#F:S16); Table [S8]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S8), [S9]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S9)) suggest that our two-step SVM approach is also effective at detecting target genes at protein level. #### &nbsp; {#F:6} {: .no_toc } ![Figure 6]({{ fig6 }}){:width=\"{{ page.figs.fig6[1] }}\"} ##### **Figure 6**.

We verified two data selection criteria, (i) inclusion and exclusion of up regulated targets in the negative record sets, and (ii) different log ratio threshold values to create positive record sets. The results suggest that our SVM approach is very flexible and robust, and it can retain its performance even when trained and tested on datasets created by different parameter settings (see Additional file 1:[Supplementary Results]({{ page_suppl_info }}#S:2-5)). ## Conclusions {#S:4} We have presented and evaluated a novel two-step SVM-based miRNA target prediction model that recognizes the individual characteristics of functional binding sites and the global characteristics of miRNA-targeted mRNAs. When tested on several different benchmarks, the model generally outperformed other well-known miRNA target prediction algorithms. In particular, the two-step SVM showed a much stronger ability to identify true miRNA targets among genes that all are likely targets with conserved stringent seed sites. The model relies on several target site and mRNA characteristics and its design is flexible so that it is easy to integrate new characteristics when such are reported. Our current model does not include target site accessibility and conservation information, however, as our tests showed that these were not important features in our model. This result is very important for genome-wide analysis because assessing target site conservation and especially target site accessibility have high computational costs. Consequently, the model can for example be used online for identifying siRNA off-targets. By modeling miRNA targeting in two steps – recognition of individual target sites and regulation of mRNA – we have incorporated several new characteristics neglected by other tools, such as miRNAs’ distance dependence for synergistic regulation. Moreover, through this two-step modeling, we have introduced several features that effectively capture the number and relative strength of individual target sites within target candidates. Our results show that these features are the most important characteristics for identifying miRNA-regulated genes. A potential limitation is that our model is trained on data from over-expression experiments, which to some extent are affected by interactions with endogenous miRNAs {% cite Khan2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. Including data from Argonaute (AGO) pull-down {% cite Karginov2007 Hendrickson2008 Chi2009 Hafner2010 -f {{ bib }} %} or miRNA knock-down {% cite Linsley2007 Baek2008 Selbach2008 -f {{ bib }} %} experiments could reduce potential bias from such interactions, but may also introduce additional bias. Most of the current AGO pull-down experiments were, for example, done with ectopically expressed and tagged AGO-fusion proteins {% cite Karginov2007 Hendrickson2008 Hafner2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. As for miRNA knock-down, there are currently few datasets available. Another potential limitation is that our model was trained on data from human cell lines. Although the miRNA regulatory mechanisms appear to be shared in animals, we cannot discount species-specific variation, which may result in the current human-optimized model having sub-optimal performance in, for example, invertebrates. Testing and optimizing the model on high-throughput data from additional species – especially species that are remotely related to humans – would therefore be interesting future work. Even though our new model represents a significant step towards accurate miRNA target prediction, it is still challenging to achieve very precise target predictions because many miRNAs have spatial, temporal, or cell-type-specific expression. Integrating target predictions with expression profiles of miRNAs and putative targets can be one way to improve predictions; for example, by taking into account miRNA saturation {% cite Khan2009 -f {{ bib }} %}, target concentration {% cite Arvey2010 -f {{ bib }} %}, or expression of RNA binding proteins {% cite Jacobsen2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. Our two-step SVM should be ideal for such analyses, as it has a high sensitivity and better overall performance compared with existing target prediction methods. ## Methods {#S:5} ### Datasets {#S:5-1} We downloaded the Jackson {% cite Jackson2006 -f {{ bib }} %}, Lim {% cite Lim2005 -f {{ bib }} %}, Grimson {% cite Grimson2007 -f {{ bib }} %}, and Linsley {% cite Linsley2007 -f {{ bib }} %} datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database [GEO:GSE5814, GEO:GSE2075, GEO:GSE8501, GEO:GSE6838] {% cite Barrett2007 -f {{ bib }} %} and the Birmingham {% cite Birmingham2006 -f {{ bib }} %} dataset from the ArrayExpress database [ArrayExpress:E-MEXP-668] {% cite Parkinson2009 -f {{ bib }} %}. We mapped microarray probes to human RefSeq transcripts (hg18) based on GEO and ArrayExpress annotations and downloaded 3' UTR sequences from the University of California, Santa Cruz {% cite UCSC2010 -f {{ bib }} %}. Two proteomics datasets, Selbach {% cite Selbach2008 -f {{ bib }} %} and Baek {% cite Baek2008 -f {{ bib }} %}, were obtained from the original publications along with miRBase and RefSeq IDs. MicroRNA and siRNA sequence data (Additional file 1:Table [S6]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S6)) were obtained from miRBase (release 14.0) {% cite Griffiths-Jones2008 -f {{ bib }} %} and from the original publications, respectively. We used several criteria, including p-values and log intensity ratios (see Additional file 1:[Supplementary Methods]({{ page_suppl_info }}#S:1-1)), to divided the data into positive (down-regulated) and negative genes. ### Construction of target site level features {#S:5-2} Potential target sites were identified by nine seed types (8mer, 7mer-A1, 7mer-m8, 6mer, GUM, GUT, LP, BM and BT) in human 3' UTRs between position 15 from the stop codon and the 3' end. Partially overlapping sites were only allowed among the sites with 8mer, 7mer-A1, 7mer-m8, and 6mer. The precedence of selecting a target site among overlapping sites was defined as 8mer = 7mer-A1 = 7mer-m8 = 6mer > GUM > GUT > LP > BM > BT. Consequently, if a GUM and GUT site overlapped, the GUM site was selected. Target sites and their corresponding miRNAs were aligned using the emboss needle software {% cite Rice2000 -f {{ bib }} %}; see Additional file 1:Table [S7]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S7) for needle parameters. We used 24 target site level features (Additional file 1:Table [S1]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S1)). Site accessibility features were created by the PITA software (version 3) by considering either no flanking regions or flanking regions consisting of 3 nts upstream and 15 nts downstream of the site {% cite Kertesz2007 -f {{ bib }} %}. Evolutionary conservation scores were calculated from phastCons 44, phyloP 44, and multiz 17-way {% cite Blanchette2004 Siepel2005 Pollard2010 -f {{ bib }} %} scores downloaded from UCSC. The phastCons 44 scores were used to calculate the average score of the whole target site (position 1 to 20), whereas the phyloP 44 scores were used as the conservation scores of the seed site (position 1 to 8). All feature values were normalized into values ranged between -1 and 1 by a linear transform based on the feature’s minimum and maximum values among the sites in the training set. ### Construction of mRNA level features {#S:5-3} Construction of mRNA level training data was done in three steps. First, discriminant values, which are the output values from SVM classification, were obtained from the target site level 10-fold cross-validation test sets. In our model, these discriminant values represented the predicted regulatory strength of each target site. Second, discriminant values were matched to mRNAs such that an mRNA with for example three miRNA target sites would have three discriminant values – one value for each site. Third, the discriminant values and other information about the target sites and the 3' UTR were used to calculate 17 mRNA level features (Additional file 1:Table [S3]({{ page_suppl_info }}#T:S3)). SVMs require fixed-length feature vectors, but the number of target sites varies between mRNAs. Consequently, to represent the number and predicted strength of individual target sites within a given mRNA, we used a feature representation that encoded the overall distribution of target site level discriminant values. For each mRNA, this feature consisted of 16 values that counted the number of target site discriminant values that fell within given percentile ranges of the overall discriminant value distribution. Specifically, two feature values counted the number of upper and lower extreme discriminant values greater than and less than two standard deviations away from the distribution mean. The remaining 14 feature values counted the number of discriminant values falling within the bins defined by the 25.00, 43.75, 57.81, 68.36, 76.27, 82.20, 86.65, 89.99, 92.49, 94.37, 95.78, 97.19, 98.6, and 100 percentiles when the upper and lower extreme values were removed from the discriminant value distribution. We used these percentile thresholds because we expected a high resolution at the upper tail of the discriminant value distribution to be useful for predictions. Supporting this hypothesis, replacing these 14 thresholds with 14 uniformly spaced thresholds gave markedly poorer SVM performance (data not shown). ### Target site / mRNA level training {#S:5-4} We used the PyML library (Version 0.72) {% cite PyML2010 -f {{ bib }} %} for SVM training, 10-fold cross-validation, classification, and evaluation, and the R package ROCR {% cite Sing2005 -f {{ bib }} %} to plot Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves and to calculate the area under the ROC curve (AUC). To optimize our model, we tested a linear kernel and three non-linear kernels – Gaussian, homogeneous polynomial, and inhomogeneous polynomial. In addition to the four kernel types, three parameters – cost factor (C), gamma (γ), and degree (d) – were tested. The parameter ranges were C = 2(2n - 5) (0 ≤ n ≤ 11), γ = 2(2n - 13) (0 ≤ n ≤ 10), and d = n (2 ≤ n ≤ 8) as previously recommended {% cite Hsu2003 -f {{ bib }} %}. ### Data retrieval for benchmarks {#S:5-5} Prediction data were downloaded from the PITA, TargetScan, MicroCosm, miRDB, and PicTar websites (see Additional file 1:[Supplementary Methods]({{ page_suppl_info }}#S:1-2)). ## Additional files {#S:6} Additional file 1 – [Supplementary information]({{ page_suppl_info }}) \\ File name: [supplementary_information.pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Saito_2010_Two_step_SVM_supplementary_information.pdf) \\ File format: PDF \\ The file contains five sections of supplementary information, and the sections are: [Supplementary Methods]({{ page_suppl_info }}#S:1) (3 subsections), [Supplementary Results]({{ page_suppl_info }}#S:2) (6 subsections), [Supplementary Tables]({{ page_suppl_info }}#S:3) (15 tables), [Supplementary Figures]({{ page_suppl_info }}#S:4) (22 figures), and the [Reference]({{ page_suppl_info }}#S:5). ## Authors' contributions {#S:7} Both authors contributed to the underlying ideas of the method and the analysis.
